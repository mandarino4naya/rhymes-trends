I don't know if you could take it
Know you wanna see me nakey, nakey, naked
I wanna be your baby, baby, baby
Spinnin' and it's wet just like it came from Maytag
White girl wasted on that brown liquor
When I get like this, I can't be around you
I'm too lit to dim down a notch
'Cause I could name some things that I'm gon' do

Wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts

Let's go


I hope you know I'm for the takin' (Uh)
You know this cookie's for the bakin'
Kitty, kitty, baby, give that thing some rest (You're the best)
'Cause you done beat it like the '68 Jets (Uh)
Diamonds ain't nothin' when I'm rockin' with ya
Diamonds ain't nothin' when I'm shinin' with ya
Just keep it white and black as if I'm your sister
I'm too hip to hop around town out here with ya

I know I get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts

Ayy, I heard that pussy for the takin'
I heard it got these other niggas goin' crazy
Yeah, I'll treat you like a lady, lady (Ayy, then I'll)
Fuck you 'til you burned out, cremation ('Til you burned out)
Make it cream, yeah, Wu-Tang (Wu-Tang)
Throw that ass back, bouquet (Bouquet)
Call me and I can get it juicy
I can tell you're gone off the D'USSÉ (Oh yeah, yeah)
Careful, mama, watch what you say (You say)
You talkin' to me like your new bae (New bae)
Girl, you talkin' like you tryna do things
Now that pipe got her runnin' like she Usain, baby
You made me drown in it, ooh, touché, baby
I'm carrying that water, Bobby Boucher, baby
And you know I'ma slaughter like I'm Jason
Bust it, why you got it on safety?
White girl wasted on brown liquor (
That brown liquor
)
I probably shouldn't be around you (
Can't be around you
)
'Cause you get
wild, wild, wild
(Wild)
You lookin' like there's nothin' that you won't do (What you wanna do?)
Ayy, girl, that's when I told you (That's when I told you)


When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
