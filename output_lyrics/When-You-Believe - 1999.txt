
Many nights we've prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could
Oh yes
[Chorus: Whitney Houston &
Mariah Carey
]
There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe
Oh
(Mmm, yeah)

In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer birds
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My heart's so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought I'd say

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Whitney Houston),
Both
]
There can be miracles
When you believe
(When you believe)
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill (Mmm)
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve)
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe
[Bridge: Both,
Whitney Houston
,
Mariah Carey
]
They don't always happen when
you ask, uh
And it's easy to give in to your fears,
oh
(
Oh
)
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see your way clear through the rain
A small, but still,
resilient voice
Says help is very near, oh

There can be miracles (Miracles)
When you believe (Oh, when you believe)
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill (Hard to kill, oh yeah)
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve, oh)
When you believe
Somehow you will (Somehow, somehow, somehow)
Now you will
You will when you, when you believe, oh


You will when you believe
You will when you believe
Just believe (You will, you will)
Just believe
You will when you believe
