I had the time of my life
And I've never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to you
Oh, I
had the time of my life
And I've never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to you-you

You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
You-you-you-you-you-you-you-you
Ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou

I-I came up in here to rock, light a fire, make it hot
I don't wanna take no pictures, I just wanna take some shots
So come on, let's go, let's lose control
Let's do it all night 'til we can't do it no more
People rockin' to the sound, turn it up and watch it pound
We gon' rock it to the top until the roof come burnin' down
Yeah, it's hot in here, the temperature
Has got these ladies gettin' freakier


I got freaky, freaky, baby, I was chillin' with my ladies
I didn't come to get bougie, I came here to get crazy
I was born to get wild, that's my style
If you didn't know that, well, baby, now you know now

'Cause I'm
Havin'
A good time with you
I'm tellin' you

All-All these girls, they like my swagger,

I be rollin' like a Stone, jet-setter, jet-lagger
We ain't messin' with no maggots, messin' with the baddest
Chicks in the club, honey, what's up?
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the baddest of them all?
Yeah, it's gotta be the apl, I'm the mack daddy, y'all
Haters better step back, ladies,

I'm the party application, rockin' just like that

For every ending is mega starter
When they bring the dark, we bring the light
Let's go
