
See, I believe in money, power and respect
First you get the money, then you get the motherfuckin' power
After you get the fuckin' power, motherfuckers will respect you (What's the key to life?)

Money, power and respect what you need in life
Money, power and respect, you'll be eatin' right
Money, power and respect, you can sleep at night
You'll see the light, what's the key to life?
Money, power and respect what you need in life
Money, power and respect, you'll be eatin' right
Money, power and respect, money, power and respect
Money, power and respect
[Verse 1: Sheek Louch &
Lil Kim
]
Ayo, my whole clique 'bout it, 'bout it
We take yours while you pout about it
Truck, step out, the whores wanna crowd around it
You could see me on Optimum TV
Go in your bathroom turn the light out
Scream, "Bloody Mary, 1, 2, 3"
Sheek ain't your usual friend
But I could set you up like Keyser and walk straight at the end
I'm done with ice and charms
I'm tryna ice my whole casket when I'm gone
Pull up with class on the don, once I meet 'em I greet 'em
Kiss his feet for freedom, tell em' thank you Lord
'Cause on Earth I was gettin' bored
Now resurrect me back to this cat called Sheek
So I can make this album and get back the cats that's weak
Two-thirty, six two
Me budge for you? That's like a cat vers' a pitbull
Gun, know clip full, keep hunger
And plan for the future, 'cause you figure you gon' be older
Way longer than you gon' be younger (
What's the key to life?

[Verse 2: Styles P &
Lil Kim
]
Only time could tell how the clock tick
I'm really loved here, but I'm still a hostage
Two personalities, check the posture
Smoke out the mouth, flare out the nostrils
Think of death, then life seem scary
I'm passin' graveyards seein' people Hail Mary
I ain't chillin' 'til I'm out parachutin'
Race my man in mountain climbin' for about ten diamonds
Twenty five thousand a piece, fuck streets
Tryin' to own the island, forget about wildin'
Try ridin' in the car that be glidin'
If I showed you where I lived, you would think I was hidin'
Sling dick to chicks that don't speak English
Wake up in Trinidad like, "Fuck it, I'm rich"
Come back, private jet, live on set
If you can shit gold, then I can spit baguettes
(

[Verse 3: Jadakiss &
Lil Kim
]
Nothin' but the hotness whenever we drop this
Monotonous for y'all to keep hatin' 'cause y'all never gon' stop us
I keep my rocks spotless and my hoes topless
Take time, try to figure out who The Lox is
Fear no one, kick rhymes like shoguns
You scared to blow one, get robbed with your own gun
If I don't respect you I'ma check you
And if I don't kiss you I'ma peck you
Right before I wet you I sneeze on tracks and bless you
I'm special and if you like workin' out then I'm gon' stretch you
Hustlin' is dead, but we still get red
Turn the spots into bakeries to get back bread
And y'all said my money's spent, but it's in the Bent'
So when the Feds come, the dogs can't get a scent
And my story, self-explanatory
That I'm the hottest thing on the street
And y'all ain't got nothin' for me (
What's the key to life?
), yeah

[Verse 4: DMX &
Lil Kim
]
This is a beat that I can freak to, just drop the reels
Bless a nigga with the ill, y'all niggas know my skills
X in their grills, hit 'em up, split 'em up
Wet 'em up and watch 'em come get 'em up
Set em' up, when you do dirt, you get dirt
Bitch, I'll make your shit hurt, step back like, "I did work"
This ain't no fuckin' game, what, you think I'm playin'?
'Til you layin' somewhere in the junkyard decayin'
Moms at home prayin' that you comin' home, but you not
'Cause you sittin' up in the trunk, startin' to rot
And hell is hot, I know because I'm here now, baby
It's goin' down, baby,
get the four pound, baby
And let off up in a nigga
Especially if he think he bigger than my motherfuckin' trigger
Dead eye, can I get mine? Is he gone?
DMX representin' one time, put us on (
What's the key to life?
