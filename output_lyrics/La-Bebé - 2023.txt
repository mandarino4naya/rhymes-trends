[Pre-Chorus: Peso Pluma &
Yng Lvcas
]
Let loose, crazy, then get soaked
Get wet from my body, you know, in the Benz, get in
What's up? My baby in the Mercedes-Benz
The stars on the ceiling, stellar has already left
But you know that this night you're for me
Come, climb on top of me, send me your location, I'll pick you up

She wants me to play music for her
So the baby dances all the way down
We drank a couple bottles
And still, she remembers that we did it yestеrday
She wants me to play music for her
So thе babe dances all the way down
We drank a couple bottles
And still, she remembers that we did it yesterday

She has not yet forgotten how we spent time
We went to the club and the two of us danced close together
Like dogs close together, kisses and a couple drinks
She stayed by my side and said, "I think I fell in love"
She smokes, she drinks
She's a little devil, small, but spicy
I love it when she rubs it against my pants
She loves it, you can see it in her face, she enjoys it


She's got a boyfriend and doesn't behave
She tells me, "Chill, 'cause the relationship is broken"
Our bodies crash and crash
Our mouths get together, the leggings choke her

She wants me to play music for her
So the babe dances all the way down
We drank a couple bottles
And still, she remembers that we did it yesterday
She wants me to play music for her
So the babe dances all the way down
We drank a couple bottles
And still, she remembers that we did it yesterday

Yesterday,
yesterday
you were moving very well, very well
She got covered in the smell of Chanel
We're a thousand degrees Fahrenheit
She's hot and has a pretty face
You play music for her, and she gets horny by herself
For the party, she never holds back
A couple friends, she completes the crew
But you, mama, you know, I like you a lot
Crazy, come here, get close all the way back
You and me will go on a fleeting journey
Interstellar, eat you out
We will both smoke marijuana
In my room, on my rooftop and on my bed
Bae, I think you're getting a call, answer tomorrow
Don't let the fire die
On the AMG, listening to "Ruedas y Cristal"
Burning poison that got me flying, mami
A little kiss to the Barbie, so she dances close
Slanty eyes like Puki from Taiwan, -an
Like Puki from Taiwan
Like Puki from Taiwan
I eat that pussy whenever I want, mami, mami

Let loose, crazy, then get soaked (
Baby, all the way down
)
Get wet from my body, you know, in the Benz, get in (
Baby, all the way down
)
What's up? My baby in the Mercedes-Benz (
Baby, all the way down
)
The stars on the ceiling, stellar one has already left (Eh)

Oh, she wants me to play music for her
So the babe dances all the way down
We drank a couple bottles
And still, she remembers that we did it yesterday
She wants me to play music for her
So the babe dances all the way down
We drank a couple bottles
And still, she remembers that we did it yesterday
[Outro: Peso Pluma &

Today is the night to be single
She likes twerking and dancing close to you
The young religion
The double P
Lil Yng
It's the remix
