Rhythm is a dancer
It's a soul's companion
People feel it everywhere, mm
Lift your hands and voices
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air

Oh, it's a passion
Oh, you can feel it in the air
Oh, it's a passion
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Rhythm is a dancer
It's a soul's companion
People feel it everywhere, mm
Lift your hands and voices
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air

Oh

How very like the future this place might be
It's a tiny world just big enough to support the cubicle of one Knowledge Worker
Feel a wave of loneliness, head back down
But I'm going too fast


Rhythm is a dancer
It's a soul's companion
People feel it everywhere, mm
Lift your hands and voices
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air

Oh

I plunge right on through the office door and into the bottomless indigo below
Suddenly, I can't remember how to stop, turn around
Do I point behind myself?
Do I have to turn around before I can point?
I flip into a brain fugue

Rhythm is a dancer
It's a soul's companion
People feel it everywhere, mm
Lift your hands and voices
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air


Oh
