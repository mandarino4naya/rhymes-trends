
I just want you to stay
Hate seeing you in pain
Just wanna be okay
Without you's not the same
You're rippin' me apart
Tearin' out my heart
To think we've come this far
The end is where it start
Nah nah no
Nah nah no
Nah nah no
Nah nah no

I just can't help but lose control
I tend to get emotional
These feelings never overthrown
Without you in the dark alone
And baby girl I know you know
That when we meet it's like we're home
But you just chose to feel so cold
We could've been inseparable oh no

I just want you to feel
Because baby I know that what I have for you is real
She crashed the car and took the wheel
Never could've made a deal
Everybody knows the drill
Everybody knows the drill


All the stranger things that I find funny
I got about eleven reasons not to call you honey
You got me feelin' bummy
But girl I ain't no dummy
I just want you to love me
So leave me with what's left and please just pray for my recovery
'Cause if you can't let me go
Look into my eyes, see my soul
This love on me, it has took a toll
Never know who I'm not too old

I just want you to stay
I see you everyday
Pull up in the range
I wanna run away
Why would you run away from me?
Why would you not come pray for me?
My soul is leaving, my body's bleeding
I don't believe this
I don't believe it
But I need you to leave this alone
And I don't want you to cry
You should just go home
Just go home


I just want you to stay
Hate seeing you in pain
Just wanna be okay
Without you's not the same
You're rippin' me apart
Tearin' out my heart
To think we've come this far
The end is where it start
