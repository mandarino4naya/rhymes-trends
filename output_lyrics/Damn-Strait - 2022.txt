
Nobody In His Right Mind Would've Left Her
That was her favorite song
She sang along every time it came on
The first time we danced was to
Marina Del Rey
And I fell right there and then
I didn't want that song to end
Baby Blue
was the color of her eyes
I can still see them in my mind
Probably will for the rest of my life

Damn strait, you're killing me, man
You know I've always been your biggest fan
Now I can't even listen
'Cause I'll get to missin' her
Then the hurt gets worse
Damn strait, I used to love your songs
But now every time that one comes on
My heart gets broke in half
But do I wish I could get her back?
Damn straight

The other day right out of the
Blue Clear Sky
You came on in my truck
I couldn't turn it off fast enough
I tried to get back in the game
But this ole heart just ain't the same
Hell, I can't even
Give It Away


Damn strait, you're killing me, man
You know I've always been your biggest fan
Now I can't even listen
'Cause I'll get to missin’ her
Then the hurt gets worse
Damn strait, I used to love your songs
But now every time that one comes on
My heart gets broke in half
But do I wish I could get her back?
Damn straight

I know it ain't your fault
That she left me
And you know you'll always be the king
But right now
I Hate Everything

Damn strait, you're killing me, man
You know I've always been your biggest fan
Now I can't even listen
'Cause I’ll get to missin' her
Then the hurt gets worse
Damn strait, I used to love your songs
But now every time that one comes on
My heart gets broke in half
But do I wish I could get her back?
Damn straight
Damn strait


Nobody In His Right Mind Would've Left Her
That was her favorite song
She sang along everytime it came on
