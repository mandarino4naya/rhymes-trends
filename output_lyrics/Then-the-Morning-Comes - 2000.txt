
Good morning

Paint the town, take a bow, thank everybody
You're gonna do it again
You are the few, the proud,
you are the antibody
Mind, soul, and zen

And the world's a stage
(And the world's a faze)
And the end is near
So push rewind, just in time, thank anybody
You're gonna do it again

The way that you walk
It's just the way that you talk, like it ain't no thing
And every single day is just a fling
Then the morning comes

Take your knocks, shake 'em off,
duck everybody
You're gonna take 'em again
You are your foe, your friend,
you are the paparazzi
You are the tragedian


And the world's a craze
(And the world's a faze)
And the end is near
So push rewind, just in time, thank anybody
You're gonna do it again

The way that you walk
It's just the way that you talk, like it ain't no thing
And every single day is just a fling

And when it comes, it moves so slow
Kinda like it's sayin', "I told you so"
Lookin' back before she goes
Tomorrow's gonna hurt

And the world's a stage
(And the world's a faze)
And the end is near
So push rewind, just in time, thank anybody
It's just the way that you walk

It's just the way that you talk, like it ain't no thing
And every single day is just a fling
Then the morning comes
