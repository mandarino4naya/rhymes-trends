
When you have no light to guide you
And no one to walk beside you
I will come to you
Oh, I will come to you
When the night is dark and stormy
You won't have to reach out for me
I will come to you
Oh, I will come to you

Sometimes when all your dreams may have seen better days
When you don't know how and why, but you've lost your way
Have no fear when your tears are fallin'
I will hear your spirit callin'
And I swear that I'll be there, come what may

When you have no light to guide you
And no one to walk beside you
I will come to you
Oh, I will come to you
When the night is dark and stormy
You won't have to reach out for me
I will come to you
Oh, I will come to you


Nanannanananannanana...
I will come to you..
Cause even if we can't be together
We'll be friends now and forever
And I swear that I'll be there come what may...

When the night is dark and stormy
You won't have to reach out for me
I will come to you
Oh I will come to you

We all need somebody we can turn to
Someone who'll always understand
So if you feel that your soul is dyin'
And you need the strength to keep tryin'
I'll reach out and take your hand
Nananananannana...
I'll reach out for your hand..
I will come to you


When you have no light to guide you
And no one to walk beside you
I will come to you
Oh, I will come to you
When the night is dark and stormy
You won't have to reach out for me
I will come to you
Oh, I will come to you

I will come to you...
Oh I will come to you...
Ohh, I will come to you
Oh I will come to you...
Ohh, I will come to you
