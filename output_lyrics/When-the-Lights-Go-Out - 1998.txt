
Yeah, I like that
You know what I mean?
You look kinda fly tonight, girl
Yo, what's up?
Check it
Baby, when the lights go out (yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
I'll show you what it's all about
Comin' at you, girl
You know you like this, girl
Here we go
(Check it)

I ain't sorry for the way I feel
I know you think I'm being insincere
From the way I'm treating you
I never wanted to be so unkind
The only one thing on my mind
Is just kicking it with you, girl

Baby, it's not the way I feel
You know you must believe me (you must believe)
Baby, it's not part of the deal
Oh no, no


Baby, when the lights go out
Every single word could not express
The love and tenderness
I'll show you what it's all about
Babe, I swear you will succumb to me
So, baby, come to me
When the lights go out

(Uh, yeah, check it, check it out)
(Second verse, girl)

I know you think it may be just a lie
Ain't no good in putting up a fight
'Cause my heart is set on you
I see the truth, it's in your eyes
I ain't fooled by your thin disguise
I can see I'm getting through, babe

Girl, don't deny the way you feel
You know you gotta trust me (you gotta trust)
Give me a chance to prove I'm real
Oh yeah, yeah


Baby, when the lights go out
Every single word could not express
The love and tenderness
I'll show you what it's all about
Babe, I swear you will succumb to me
So, baby, come to me
Baby, when the lights go out
Every single word could not express
The love and tenderness
I'll show you what it's all about
Babe, I swear you will succumb to me
So, baby, come to me
When the lights go out

When I flick da switch, make ya hips wanna dip now
I can get you off 'cause I'm ready and equipped now
Swing for me baby, give me all you got
Never wanna stop 'cause you make me feel hot
I know what you wanna do
And that I feel the same way too
Give you what you want
Through the days and the nights
Yeah, it's about time that we turned out the lights


(Yeah, I like that)
(Yo, what's up?)
(Check it)

Baby, when the lights go out
Every single word could not express
The love and tenderness
I'll show you what it's all about
Babe, I swear you will succumb to me
So, baby, come to me
When the lights go out
Baby, when the lights go out (when the lights go out)
Every single word could not express
The love and tenderness
I'll show you what it's all about (show you what it's all about)
Babe, I swear you will succumb to me (alright)
So, baby, come to me
When the lights go out
Baby, when the lights go out
Every single word could not express
The love and tenderness
