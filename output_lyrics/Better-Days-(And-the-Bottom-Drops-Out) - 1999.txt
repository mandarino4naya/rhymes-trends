(It goes a little something like, like, like this)

In my shoes my toes are busted
My kitchen says my bread is molded
I got a good job at the dollar store
One foot in the hole, one foot getting deeper
With a broken mirror and a blown-out speaker
I ain't got much else to lose
I'm faded, flat busted
Been jaded, I've been dusted
I know that I've seen better days
One foot in the hole, one foot getting deeper
Crank it to eleven, blow another speaker
And I ain't got, I ain't got much to lose

Cause I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
And the bottom drops out
I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
And the bottom drops out


Now, my cup's filled up with five-buck wine
I find myself here all the time
Another rip in the glass, another chip in my tooth
Rained on, I've been stained on
Found another goat I try to put the blame on
And now I'm stepping on all the cracks, so I guess there ain't no use

Cause I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
And the bottom drops out
I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
And the bottom drops out

Like my Gucci bag?
That's beautiful, beautiful
Check it, check it out

I'm bent like glass, second hand like glory
Missed the bus, but I'm in no hurry
Molasses fast, no business born
One foot in the hole, one foot getting deeper
Crank it to eleven, blow another speaker
And I ain't got, I ain't got much to lose


Cause I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
And the bottom drops out
I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
And the bottom drops out

I know that I've seen better days
(And the bottom drops out)
I've been the star of so many plays
(And the bottom drops out)
I walked on the edge without a hold whole way
(And the bottom drops out)
Cause I know, I know that I've seen better, better days
(And the bottom drops out)
(Now I'm real thirsty)
