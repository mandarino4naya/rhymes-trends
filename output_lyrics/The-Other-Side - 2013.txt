

In the beginnin'
I never thought it would be you
When we were chillin'
Smilin' in the photobooth
But we got closer (Yeah)
Soon you were eating off my spoon
You're comin' over
And we would talk all afternoon

Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
"We're goin' all the way"

Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road, we'll be lovers for sho'
So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side


Ayy, this could be perfect (Yeah)
But we won't know unless we try (Try)
I know you're nervous
So just sit back and let me drive

Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
"We're goin' all the way"

Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road, we'll be lovers for sho'
So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side

Oh-oh-oh, ooh
Oh-oh-oh, ooh
Oh-oh-oh, ooh (Kiss me like it's do or die)
Oh-oh-oh, ooh (And take me to the other side)


Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Let your love crash into me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
"We're goin' all the way"

Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July (Blastin' through the air)
Just take me to the other side (Take me, baby)
I see that sexy look in your eyes (Ooh)
And I know, we ain't friends anymore (Oh yeah)
If we walk down this road, we'll be lovers for sho'
So tonight (So tonight)
Kiss me like it's do or die (Kiss me, kiss me)
And take me to the other side

Oh-oh-oh, ooh (Take me to the other side)
Oh-oh-oh, ooh (And take me to the other side)
Oh-oh-oh, ooh (Kiss me like it's do or die)
Oh-oh-oh, ooh (And take me to the other side)
