
Honey, why you callin' me so late?
It’s kinda hard to talk right now
Honey, why you cryin'? Is everything okay?
I gotta whisper 'cause I can't be too loud

Oh, well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

It’s really good to hear your voice
Sayin' my name, it sounds so sweet
Comin' from the lips of an angel
Hearin' those words, it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It‘s funny that you're callin' me tonight
And yes, I've dreamt of you too
Does he know you're talkin' to me
Will it start a fight?
No, I don't think she has a clue

(Never wanna say goodbye)

Honey, why you callin' me so late?
