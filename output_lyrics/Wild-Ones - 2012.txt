
Hey, I heard you were a wild one
Ooh, ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club with you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones, wild ones, wild ones
Ooh, ooh

Oh, I-I like crazy, foolish, stupid
Party goin' wild, fist pumpin' music
I might lose it, glass to the roof
That's how we do's it, do's it, do's it
I don't care tonight, she don't care we like
Almost there, the right vibe, ready to get live
Ain't no surprise, take me so high
Jump and nose dive, surfinâ€™ the crowd
Ooh, ooh
Said, I gotta be the man, I'm the head of my band
Mic check, one, two
Shut 'em down in the club, what a playboy does
And they all get loose, loose off the bottle
We all get bent then again tomorrow
Gotta break rules 'cause that's the motto
Club shut down, a hundred super models

[Chorus: Sia,
Sia & Flo Rida

Hey, I heard you were a wild one
Ooh, ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club
with you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones, wild ones, wild ones
Ooh, ooh

P-p-party rocker, fa' sho' stopper
More Chambull, number one club popper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Can't see me with ten binoculars
So cool, no doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes comin' off then I make that move
Somehow, some way, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through
Uh-oh, it's on like everything goes
Wild out, baby, 'til the freak, it shows
What happens to that body is a private show
Stays right here, pri-private show
I like 'em untamed, I'm talkin' high pain
Tolerance, bottoms up with the champagne
My life, call my homie then we hit Spain
Keep it busy with the bail, we get insane

[Chorus: Sia,
Sia & Flo Rida
]
Hey, I heard you were a wild one
Ooh, ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club
with you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones, wild ones, wild ones
Ooh, ooh
[Bridge: Sia,
Flo Rida

Both

I am a wild one, break me in (
Yeah
)
Saddle me up and let's begin (
Yeah
)
I am a wild one, tame me now (
Now
)
Running with wolves and I'm on the prowl
Show you another side of me
A side you would never thought you would see
Tear up that body, dominate you 'til you've had enough
I hear you like the wild stuff
[Chorus: Sia & Flo Rida,
Sia
]
Hey, I heard you were a wild one
Ooh, ooh
(
Oh
)
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club
with you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones, wild ones, wild ones
Ooh, ooh


I am a wild one, break me in
Saddle me up and let's begin
I am a wild one, tame me now
Running with wolves and I'm on the prowl
