
I wouldn't mind bein' alone
I wouldn't keep checkin' my phone
Wouldn't take the long way home
Just to drive myself crazy
I wouldn't be losin' sleep
Rememberin' everything
Everything you said to me
Like I'm doin' lately

You, you wouldn't be all
All that I want
Baby, I could let go

If I didn't love you I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely gettin' by somehow
Yeah, it would be easy not to miss you
Wonder about who's with you
Turn the want you off whenever I want to
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you
[Verse 2: Carrie Underwood &
Jason Aldean
]
I wouldn't still cry sometimes
Wouldn't have to fake a smile
Play it off and tell a lie
When somebody asked how I've been
I'd try to find someone new (
Someone new
)
It should be somethin' I can do (
I can do
)
Baby, if it weren't for you
I wouldn't be in the state that I'm in


Yeah, you
You wouldn't be all
All that I want
Baby, I could let go
[Chorus: Jason Aldean & Carrie Underwood,
Carrie Underwood
]
If I didn't love you I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely gettin' by somehow
Yeah, it would be easy not to miss you
Wonder about who's with you
Turn the want you off whenever I want to
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you (
Oh, if I didn't love you
)
[Bridge: Jason Aldean & Carrie Underwood,
Carrie Underwood
]
It wouldn't be so hard to see you
Know how much I need you
Wouldn't hate that I still feel like I do
If I didn't love you (
Oh, if I didn't love you
)
If I didn't love you (
Hmm, mm-hmm
)
[Chorus: Carrie Underwood,
Carrie Underwood & Jason Aldean
]
If I didn't love you I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely gettin' by somehow
Yeah, it would be easy not to miss you
Wonder about who's with you
Turn the want you off whenever I want to
If I didn't love you
(Yeah)
If I didn't love you
(Oh, if I didn't love you)
If I didn't love you (If I didn't love you)
If I didn't love you
