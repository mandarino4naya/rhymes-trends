[Intro: Cherine Anderson &
Michael Franti
]
Comme da selecta
Ayy,
uh-huh
, woo (
That's right
)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh
This one goes out to you and yours, worldwide
[Chorus: Michael Franti &
Cherine Anderson
]
I say, "Hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way"
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know (
I know
) one thing (
One thing
), that I love you (Baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you (It's true)
[Verse 1: Michael Franti &
Cherine Anderson
]
I've been a lot of places all around the way (
Yeah?
)
I've seen a lot of joy, and I've seen a lot of pain
But I don't want to write a love song for the world
I just want to write a song about a boy and a girl
Junkies on the corner always callin' my name (Okay)
And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games
When I saw you gettin' down, girl, I hope it was you
And when I look into your eyes, I knew it was true (
Hahaha
)
[Chorus: Michael Franti &
Cherine Anderson
]
I say, "Hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way" (Uh-huh)
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know (
I know
) one thing (
One thing
), that I love you (Baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you (
Haha
)

[Verse 2: Michael Franti &
Cherine Anderson
]
Now, I'm not a highly metaphysical man
But I know when the stars are aligned, you can (
Okay
)
Bump into a person in the middle of the road
Look into their eyes, and you suddenly know
Rocking in the dance hall, moving with you (Rockin', rockin',
woo
)
Dancin' in the night light in the middle of June
My momma told me, don't lose you
'Cause the best luck I had was you (
True
)
[Chorus: Michael Franti &
Cherine Anderson
]
I say, "Hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way" (
You Promise?
)
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know (
The more I see, the less I know
)
But I know (
I know
) one thing (
One thing
), that I love you (Baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you
[Bridge: Michael Franti &
Cherine Anderson
]
And I say, "Rockin' in the dance hall, moving with you"
I say, "Hey momma, hey momma, close to you"
Rocking in the dance hall, moving with you
I say, "Hey poppa, hey poppa, close to you"
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
I say, "Hey momma, hey momma, close to you"
Rocking in the dance hall, moving with you
I say, "Hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma
Hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma
What you gonna do?"
Well, my momma told me, don't lose you
'Cause the best luck I had was you (
Awe
)
And I know one thing, that I love you (
Ahh
)

[Chorus: Michael Franti &
Cherine Anderson
]
I say, "Hey, I'll be gone today" (Okay)
But I'll be back all around the way (
You promise?
)
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
I say, "Hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way"
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know (
I know
) one thing (
One thing
), that I love you (Baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I love you, I love you, I love you (Rocking in the dance hall, I'm moving with you)
I love you, I love you, I love you (It's true, it's true)
I love you (
Haha
), I love you (
Ha
), I love you (Haha, haha)
[Outro: Michael Franti &
Cherine Anderson
]
Rockin' in the dance hall, moving with you
(
I say, "Hey poppa, hey poppa"
)
Hey momma, hey momma
Rockin' in the dance hall, moving with you
(
Come on, hey poppa, hey poppa
)
Hey momma, hey momma
Woo
