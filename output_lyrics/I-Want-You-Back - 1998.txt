[Intro: Justin &
All

You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever needed, yeah
So tell me what to do now
'Cause...
Lance:
I...
Joey:
I...
Justin:
I...
JC:
I...
Chris:
I...
All:
I want you back

It's hard to say I'm sorry
It's hard to make the things I did undone
A lesson I've learned too well for sure
So don't hang up the phone now
I'm tryna figure out just what to do
I'm goin' crazy without you
[Chorus: All &
Justin
]
You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever needed
(yeah)
So tell me what to do now
When I want you back

[Verse 2: JC
with Chris
]
Baby, I remember
The way you used to look at me and say
"Promises never last forever"
I told you not to worry
I said that everything would be alright
I didn't know then that you were right
[Chorus: All,
Justin & JC
,
JC
]
You're all I ever wanted
(Baby, you're all)
You're all I ever needed
(yeah)
So tell me what to do now
When I want you back
(back...)

I want you back, oh oh
[Bridge: Justin &
All
]
Yeah
You're the one I want
You're the one I need
Girl, what can I do?
You're the I want
You're the one I need
Tell me, what can I do?

[Chorus: Justin, Joey & Lance,
JC & Chris
]
You're all I ever wanted
(You're the one I want)
You're all I ever needed
(You're the one I need)
So tell me what to do now
(Tell me, what can I do?)
When I want you back
[Outro: Justin &
All
]
You're all I ever wanted, hey
You're all I ever needed, yeah
So tell me what to do now
When I want you back
