
O Mount Kailas
Uncover me
Come my restoration
Wash my body clean
I've been walking along a crooked path
Where the walls have fallen and broken me in half

I'm telling you
I will not rest 'til I lay down my head
I'm gonna go
In the house of stone and light
I shall not cry for the blind man I leave behind
When I go
In the house of stone and light, yeah
In the house of stone and light

Holy lady
Show me my soul
Tell me of that place where I must surely go
Old man waiting at the gates for me
Give me the wisdom
Give me the key


I'm telling you
I will not rest 'til I lay down my head, yeah
In the house of stone and light
I make my way
Oh gonna be such a beautiful day
In the house of stone and light, oh
In the house of stone and light

Let me in
Beneath my skin
Yeah yeah
Oh
In the house of stone and light

It's been too long
My spirit's been at war
Havasupai Shaman
Let me be reborn
And I will embrace the sun upon my face

Come the day I awake the child inside
In the house of stone and light
And when I go, I will op-op-open my eyes
In the house of stone and light
I will see you
In the house of stone and light


Looking in
Beneath my skin
Yeah yeah
Oh

(In the house of stone and light)
Coming inside
(In the house of stone and light)
Stone and light, looking for the time
(In the house of stone and light)
See my [?] sunshine and shelter
(In the house of stone and light)
Oh
(In the house of stone and light)
I'm gonna let this [?] wash in the water
(In the house of stone and light)
He's speaking something to me
I must go there (In the house of stone and light)
To find my soul, yeah (I can see so clearly now)
I must go there (In the house of stone and light)
To find my soul, yeah (Don't keep on knockin' on my door)
I must go there (In the house of stone and light)
To find my soul, yeah
I must go there (In the house of stone and light)
To find my soul, yeah
I must go there
To find my soul, yeah
