[Verse 1: Carly Pearce,
Both
]
It's all on me, it's my mistake
I said I don't love you a little too late
But I guess there ain't ever a right time
And I don't know why it's called a goodbye
Go run my name into the ground
Tell everyone you know just how
How I slammed the door on our forever
But I promise you it's for the better
[Chorus: Both,
Carly Pearce
]
I hope you find what you were lookin' for
I hope your heart ain't hurtin' anymore
And you get mo
vin' on,
all fi
gured out
And you don't hate me somehow
'Cause I hope you're happy now
[Verse 2: Lee Brice,
Both
]
Who knew this heart could break this hard
Or a love like ours could fall apart
Without so much as a warnin'
I thought that I was what you wanted
[Chorus: Both,
Lee Brice
]
Well, I guess you found what you were lookin' for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothin' left
And so I hope you're happy now

[Chorus: Both,
Carly Pearce
,
Lee Brice
]
I hope you find what you were lookin' for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
Hope you get mo
vin' on,
all fi
gured out
And you
don't hate me somehow
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothin' left
So I hope
you're happy now
[Outro: Both,
Lee Brice
]
Happy now
Oh, I hope you're happy now
Mm
