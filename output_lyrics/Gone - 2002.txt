
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh...

Lying in your arms
So close together
Didn't know just what I had
Now I toss and turn
'Cause I'm without you
How I'm missing you so bad
Where was my head?
Where was my heart?
Now I cry alone in the dark
[Chorus: All,
Chris
,
Joey
]
I lie awake, I drive myself crazy
Drive myself crazy
Thinking of you
Made a mistake
when I
let you go, baby
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do
(Wanting you the way that I do)
[Verse 2: Justin
with
All
]
I was such a fool
I couldn't see it
Just how good you were to me
(Just how good you were to me)
Oh yeah
You confessed your love
(You confessed your love)
Undying
devotion
I confessed my
need to be free…
And now I'm left with all this pain
I've only got myself to blame, no…

[Chorus: All,
Justin
with Joey
]
I lie awake, I drive myself crazy
(oh yeah)
Drive myself crazy
Thinking of you
Made a mistake
(oh yeah)
Let you go, baby
(let you go)
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do
(Wanting you the way that I do)
[Bridge: JC,
All
]
Why didn't I know it?
How much I loved you, baby
Why couldn't I show it?
If I had only told you…
When I had the chance
Oh, I had the chance
Oh oh oh, oh...

Ooh ooh...

[Chorus: All,
JC
]
I lie awake, I drive myself crazy
Drive myself crazy
Thinking of you
Made a mistake
(made a mistake)
Let you go, baby
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do
I lie awake, I drive myself crazy
(I drive myself)
Drive myself crazy
(crazy, crazy)
(Crazy, crazy, yeah)
Made a mistake
(made a mistake)
Let you go, baby
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I do
[Outro: JC
with Justin
]
I drive myself crazy
Wanting you the way that I
do...
