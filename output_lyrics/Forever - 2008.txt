
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I moved to LA on a Tuesday
Then I met you on the west side and your roommate
Saw me looking at you
Saw you looking at me

I said I had big plans for the next week
I was busy, but the moment that you text me
I had nothing to do
And nowhere to be

We laughed at all the same jokes
Fogging up the windows
I want you more the more I know

I love falling in love
With you every day
I know we're growing up
But some things never change
Everybody's gonna say we're crazy
No one's ever gonna feel the way we
Do
Forever twenty-two


Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Everything is changing all around us
Feels like everybody's chasing what we found young
But we already knew
How could they compete

Still laugh at all the same jokes
Still fogging up the windows
Still want you more the more I know

I love falling in love
With you every day
I know we're growing up
But some things never change
Everybody's gonna say we're crazy
No one's ever gonna feel the way we
Do
Forever twenty-two
I still feel what I felt
Seven years ago
Don't want nobody else
I'll never let you go
Everybody's gonna say we're crazy
No one's ever gonna feel the way we
Do
Forever twenty-two


Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Everybody's gonna say we're crazy
No one's ever gonna feel the way we
Do
Forever twenty-two

I love falling in love
With you every day
I know we're growing up
But some things never change
Everybody's gonna say we're crazy
No one's ever gonna feel the way we
Do
Forever twenty-two
