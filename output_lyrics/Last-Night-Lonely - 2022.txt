
Yeah, this could be your last drink from a stranger in a bar
The last time that you're dancing in unfamiliar arms
Yeah, this could be your last first kiss, if we do this thing right
Your last time alone beneath neon lights

It could be your last night coming in here, drinking all by yourself
The last time giving your heart away to someone else
Yeah, we could be some history in the making girl, tonight
Might be your last night lonely

Yeah, you could be the last first name that's ever been worth asking
Yeah, you could be the last phone number I write down on a napkin
Yeah, you could be the last girl that I take back home to Mama
The last time that we're talked about in this small-town drama

It's gonna be the last night coming in here, drinking all by yourself
The last time giving your heart away to someone else
Yeah, we could be some history in the making girl, tonight
Might be your last night lonely
It could be your last night lonely

It could be your last night coming in here, drinking all by yourself
The last time giving your heart away to someone else
Yeah, we could be some history in the making girl, tonight
Might be your last night lonely


It could be your last night coming in here, drinking all by yourself
The last time giving your heart away to someone else
Yeah, we could be some history in the making girl, tonight
Might be your last night lonely
It could be your last night lonely, yeah
Last night lonely, baby
