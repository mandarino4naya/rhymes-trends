[Intro: Machine Gun Kelly &
blackbear
]
Ayy
You know my ex, so that makes it all feel complicated, yeah
(
It all seems complicated
)
I read those texts that you sent to yours, but I'll never say it, yeah
(
I'll never say—
)

You walked in my life at 2 a.m.
'Cause my boy's new girl is your best friend
Act like you don't see me, we'll play pretend
Your eyes already told me what you never said
Now we're in the backseat of the black car, goin' home
When she asked me, "Is it wrong if I come up with you?"
We're both drunk on the elevator
When I kiss you for the first time in New York City, uh
[Chorus:  Machine Gun Kelly &
blackbear
]
I swear to God, I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love, but I can't get enough of it (
Yeah
)

First off, I'm not sorry, I won't apologize to nobody
You play like I'm invisible, girl, don't act like you ain't saw me
Last year was a mess and how I acted was beyond me
But the past still revolves me, you text me, I ain't responding
But now shit's done changed
Go our separate ways
But look at this damage you did to me
I still want nothin' to do between you and me
Please don't say nothin', it all sounds untrue to me
We don't got nothin' to say, hey

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly &
blackbear
]
I swear to God, I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love, but I can't get enough of it (
Yeah
)
I swear to God (
I swear to God
), I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it (
I can't get enough of you
)
I swear to God (
I swear to God
), I never fall in love (
In love
)
I never fall in love, but I can't get enough of it (
I can't get enough of it, yeah
)
[Outro: Machine Gun Kelly &
blackbear
]
You know my ex, so that makes it all feel complicated, yeah
(
It all seems complicated
)
I read those texts that you sent to yours, but I'll never say it, yeah
(
I'll never say—
