
Let's get it

Girl, you gone and done it to me,
hotter than a hoochie-coochie
Got me like the first time I heard Alan Jackson "Chattahoochee"
I was never the same again, I'm a lifelong fan
Yes, I am

Baby, I love you like I love country music

You get me high as Willie
, girl, you get me
gone as Jones
You turn me on as much as I turn on my radio
Let's take our time,
walk the line kinda like
Johnny and June did
, yeah, let's do this
Baby, I love you like I love country music

'Causе I could never live without ya or my favoritе songs about ya
Top-to-bottom perfect, you're like
Brooks & Dunn's debut album
You got me feelin' like I'm a brand new man (Oh, I'm a brand new man)
Yes, I am

Baby, I love you like I love country music
(Yeah, I love country music, oh)


You get me high as Willie, girl, you get me gone as Jones
You turn me on as much as I turn on my radio
Let's take our time, walk the line kinda like
Johnny and June
did, yeah, let's do this
Baby, I love you like I love country music

Hit 'em with it, woo
Play that fiddle

If I was stranded on an island, only way I could survive is
If I had you and that needle droppin' on a vinyl

You get me high as Willie, girl, you get me gone as Jones
You turn me on as much as I turn on my radio
Let's take our time, walk the line kinda like
Johnny and June did, yeah, let's do this
Baby, I love you like I love country music
Oh, baby, I love you like I love country music

Yeah, that's right


One, two, one, two, three, woo
That's right
Baby, I love you like I love country music
Hit 'em again
