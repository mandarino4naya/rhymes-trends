Unless you got a couple friends look like you
My bad if my ex try to fight you (Ah)
Roll up soon as I roll in
Security better get with the program
Too deep, ain't nowhere to stand
So high, ain't nowhere to land
You remind me of somethin' missin'
Missus, you got my full attention
Listen, let go of the tension
If I get a minute, I'll put your bad ass in detention
