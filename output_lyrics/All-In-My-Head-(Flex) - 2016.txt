
Flex, time to impress
Come and climb in my bed
Don't be shy, do your thing
It's all in my head

I wanna flex with you, baby (I wanna flex with you, baby)
I'm tryna chill with you, throwin' bands at you
Are you flexible, baby? (Are you flexible, baby?)
Show me some different moves and I'll let you groove
'Cause it's meant to be, baby ('Cause it's meant to be, baby)
Ayy, make history, baby (Ayy, make history, baby)
And you the one for me and I'm the one for you
So come flex with me, baby, waa

Curtains like waves closing in all around us
Dimming the lights just so that they don't blind us
So tongue in cheek when we're laying on roses
But you're touching my skin and you're leaving me hopeless

I wanna feel you un—
Feel you under my body (Body, body)
I wanna feel you un—
Feel you un—
