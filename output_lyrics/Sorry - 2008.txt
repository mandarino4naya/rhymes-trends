The kitchen drawers were open
Jot water int he bath
And the phone call that you'd promised me
I'd given up on at last
I was only 22
All undone and overdue
My friends burned all around me
And the smoke was full of you
But let's stop here for a prayer
For what happened there
And let us have a beer
For anyone who's still here
I didn't leave a letter
I just wrote my baby's name
On the mirror all steamed over
With water, hear, and shame
All hopes were long-time missing
They'd had enough of me
I found them hanging through the moon
From the Hooker oak tree
The knife was on the basin
Wrapped in my baby's towel
My friend the water let me in
And I lowered myself down

Cause you can drink and you can shake
And you can dry your bitter tears
But the first to pass right through you
Will age you fifty years
And you could say "well I don't know
You got to love just the same"
But I say all i got
Was a phone call that never came
The towel was lying open
And it didn't hurt so bad
There was red smoke in the water
And all the things we'd had
Now honey you don't need this heart
Now that I'm dead and gone
So dig me up and give me back
What I never should've lost
I was falling asleep
You see I felt a little weak
I closed my eyes and thought of you
As the phone let out a ring
