
What's goin' on, Mama? Somethin' just dawned on me
I ain't been home in some months
Been chasin' songs and women, makin' some bad decisions
God knows I'm drinkin' too much

Yeah, I know you've been worryin' 'bout me
You've been losin' sleep since '93

I thought you should know, that all those prayers you thought you wasted on me
Must've finally made their way on through
I thought you should know, I got me a new girl down there in
Jefferson City
, and
She lets me fish whenever I want to
Yeah, I'm still proud of where I came from,
still your only damn son
, can you believe I'm on the radio?
Just thought you should know, thought you should know, thought you should know

Oh, by the way, Mama, didn't mean to ramblе on ya
How's everything back at home?
Yеah, how's that garden comin'?
Is Dad still doin' dumb shit?
And how'd he keep you this long?

Yeah, I'm sorry that I called you so late
I just miss you, but anyways

You've been losin' sleep since '93

I thought you should know, that all those prayers you thought you wasted on me
Must've finally made their way on through
I thought you should know, that I really like this girl down in Jefferson City, and
It turns out she's a lot like you
Yeah, I'm still proud of where I came from,
still your only damn son
, the bus is leavin' so I gotta roll
Just thought you should know, thought you should know, thought you should know

I thought you should know
Thought you should know
I thought you should know
Thought you should know
Thought you should know
