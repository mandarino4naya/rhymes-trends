Yeah, just hit me

Hey, you, in the black boots
Knee, highs, with the Daisy Dukes
Lookin' real fly while in cahoots
In the park, where I can do you
I'm L.A. Sno, here to relate to you
How I started the trend of them Daisy Dukes
Ever since the summer of the '90s
Girls lookin' good, with their future behind, see
Many terms are used to express
We're talkin' 'bout the booty, not the breast
Baby got back, the junk in the trunk
She got a six pack or a hell of a rump
Yo, please, some fries with that shake
See, many terms are used to relate
I love the girls with the big old booties
Where I'm from, they call 'em Dukies
Pretty brown cheeks hangin' from the jeans
Even city girls kick the country things
So if you get it, got it good, just dip the dug out
Them damn Daisy Dukes are turnin' her out
Sing


Come on, baby
Kick them Daisies

Look at them girls with the Daisy Dukes on
I want you to
Look at them girls with the Daisy Dukes on
Everybody
Look at them girls with the Daisy Dukes on
I want you to
Look at them girls with the Daisy Dukes on

Yeah, just hit me

Say, look at them girls with the Daisy Dukes on
They really got it goin' on
Yeah, they be kickin' it sweet
With them long old boots on feet
And check out the way they step
Make a brother wanna think about sex
Especially when they have nice legs
If they're tan, dark, or red
It don't make what kind of legs you like
Still be kickin' those legs in lily white
So it won't make one difference on you
As long as you kickin' them Daisy Dukes


Come on, baby
Kick them Daisies

Look at them girls with the Daisy Dukes on
I want you to
Look at them girls with the Daisy Dukes on
Everybody
Look at them girls with the Daisy Dukes on
I want you to
Look at them girls with the Daisy Dukes on

Yeah, just hit me
