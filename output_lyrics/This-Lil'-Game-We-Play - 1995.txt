(Ooh) Yo, baby
You ready to let the games begin? (
Oh

(Oh baby) 'Cause I'm ready (
Yeah, hey yeah, yeah yeah, hmm

On your mark, get set, here we go
Check it
[Chorus: Subway &
702

Girl, I want you to stay
So we can play this little game we play
You go hide, and I will seek
Let me be the one to make you weak (Yeah, baby)
Boy, I really wanna stay
(Yeah)
And play that little game you play
(Come on)
Where you go hide, and let me seek
Let me be the one to make you weak

Ah yeah, first verse
[Verse 1: Subway &
702
]
I'm thinking about ya, every day
Got me feelin' kinda freaky
Girl, why you wanna leave me that way?

Boy, I don't wanna leave you
So I'll stay for a little while
But we play by my rules
'Cause bein' loose just ain't my style
No no no no oh
[Chorus: Subway &
702
]
Girl, I want you to stay
So we can play this little game we play
You go hide, and I will seek
Let me be the one to make you weak
Boy, I really wanna stay
And play that little game you play
Where you go hide, and let me seek
Let me be the one to make you weak
[Verse 2: Subway &
702
]
Oh, so you wanna run things (
Mhm
)
Well, that's cool with me
You better know what you're doin' (
I know
)
Girl, I'm a hard one to please (
Ooh
)
Come on
Talk is cheap
(Yeah)
Let's get right to it
(Ooh baby)
Let the fun and games begin
Boy, I'm ready to do this

[Chorus: Subway &
702
]
Girl, I want you to stay (
Help me stay
)
So we can play this little game we play
(
But we must play in my way
)
You go hide, and I will seek
Let me be the one to make you weak
Boy, I really wanna stay
And play that little game you play
Where you go hide, and let me seek
Let me be the one to make you weak

It's your move, baby (It's your move, baby)
So show me what you got (Show me what you got)
'Cause when it's my turn (But when its my turn)
The game is gonna get hot
I like what you're sayin'
Boy, it sounds real good, real good
But are you ready for a real woman
To test your manhood?
This little game that we play (Yeah baby, it's my game)
It's just a little game that we play (But you gotta play by my rules, uh-huh)
This little game that we play (Come on)
It's just a little game that we play
(Just one lil' game real quick, here we go)

Baby, don't start if you think you can't finish
Come prepared if you think you're gonna win this
Give it your best shot
(Yeah)
Give me all you got
(Oh)
Guaranteed to make you hot
(Make me hot, baby, oh)
I wanna play this game with you
