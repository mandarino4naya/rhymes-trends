
Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell
It was love from above, that could save me from hell
She had fire in her soul, it was easy to see
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me
There were drums in the air as she started to dance
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands
And we sang

Aye-oh-aye, oh, aye-oh-aye
And the voices rang like the angels sing
We're singing
Aye-oh-aye, oh, aye-oh-aye
And we danced on into the night
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)
And we danced on into the night
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)

Like a piece to the puzzle that falls into place
You could tell how we felt from the look on our faces
We were spinning in circles with the moon in our eyes
No room left to move in-between you I
We forgot where we were and we lost track of time
And we sang to the wind as we danced through the night
And we sang


Aye-oh-aye, oh, aye-oh-aye
And the voices rang like the angels sing
We're singing
Aye-oh-aye, oh, aye-oh-aye
And we danced on into the night
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)
And we danced on into the night
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)
And we danced on into the night

Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell
It was love from above, that could save me from hell
She had fire in her soul it was easy to see
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me
There were drums in the air as she started to dance
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands
And we sang

Aye-oh-aye, oh, aye-oh-aye
And the voices rang like the angels sing
And singing
Aye-oh-aye, oh, aye-oh-aye
And we danced on into the night
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)
And we danced on into the night
(And the voices rang like the angels sing)
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)
And we danced on into the night


Aye-oh-aye, oh, aye-oh-aye
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)
Aye-oh-aye, oh, aye-oh-aye
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)
Singing Aye-oh-aye, oh, aye-oh-aye
(Aye-oh, aye-oh)
And we danced on into the night
