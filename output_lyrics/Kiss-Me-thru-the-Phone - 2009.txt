
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em

Baby, you know that I miss you, I wanna get with you
Tonight, but I cannot, baby girl, and that's the issue
Girl, you know I miss you, I just wanna kiss you
But I can't right now
So baby kiss me through the phone (Kiss me through the phone)
I'll see you later on (Later on)
Kiss me through the phone (Kiss me through the phone)
See you when I get home (When I get home)

Baby, I know that you like me, you my future wifey
Soulja Boy Tell’em, yeah
You can be my Bonnie, I can be your Clyde
You could be my wife, text me, call me
I need you in my life, yeah, all day, every day, I need ya
And every time I see ya, my feelings get deeper
[Pre-Chorus: Soulja Boy &
Sammie

I miss ya, I miss ya
I really wanna kiss you but I can't

Baby, I been thinkin’ lately so much about you
Everything about you, I like it

I love your complexion
