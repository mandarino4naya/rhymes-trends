
You see tonight, it could go either way
Hearts balanced on a razor blade
We are designed to love and break
And to rinse and repeat it all again

I get stuck when the world's too loud
And things don't look up when you're goin' down
I know your arms are reachin' out
From somewhere beyond the clouds

You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
Celestial
Celеstial

I see the light shining through the rain
A thousand colours in a brighter shadе
Needed to rise from the lowest place
There's silver lining that surrounds the grey


When I get lost, will you come back around?
Things don't look up when you're goin' down
I know your arms, they are reachin' out
From somewhere beyond the clouds

You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
Celestial
Celestial, oh

We were made to be nothin' more than this
Findin' magic in all the smallest things
The way we notice, that's what really matters
Let's make tonight go on and on and on
(You make me feel) We were made to be nothin' more than this
Findin' magic in all the smallest things
(You make me feel) The way we notice, that's what really matters
Let's make tonight go on and on and on

You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
Celestial, ohh
Celestial, ohh
Celestial, ohh


We were made to be nothin' more than this
Findin' magic in all the smallest things (Celestial, ohh)
The way we notice, that's what really matters is
Make tonight go on and on and on
Celestial
