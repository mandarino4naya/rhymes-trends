You have so many relationships in this life
Only one or two will last
You go through all the pain and strife
Then you turn your back and they're gone so fast
Oh, yeah
And they're gone so fast, yeah

Oh, so hold on the ones who really care
In the end, they'll be the only ones there
When you get old, start losing your hair
Can you tell me who will still care?
Can you tell me who will still care?

Oh, ooh, yeah, yeah
