
When it's cold outside
Am I here in vain?
Hold on to the night
There will be no shame


Open your eyes I see
Your eyes are open
Wear no disguise for me
Come into the open

Melting the ice for me
Jump into the ocean
Hold back the tide I see
Your love in motion
(Your love in motion)
(Your love in motion)
(Your love in motion)
(Your love in motion)
(Motion)
(Motion)
(Motion)
(Motion)


When it's cold outside
Am I here in vain?
Hold on to the night
There will be no shame

Always (Harmony, harmony oh love)
Always (Harmony, harmony oh love)
Always
Always (Harmony, harmony oh love)

Open your eyes I see
Your eyes are open
Wear no disguise for me
Come into the open

Melting the ice for me
Jump into the ocean
Hold back the tide I see
Your love in motion

When it's cold outside
Am I here in vain?
Hold on to the night
There will be no shame


Always (Harmony, harmony oh love)
Always (Harmony, harmony oh love)
Always
Always (Harmony, harmony oh love)

Always, I want to be with you
And make believe with you
And live in harmony, harmony oh love

Always, I want to be with you
And make believe with you
And live in harmony, harmony oh love

Always, I want to be with you
And make believe with you
And live in harmony, harmony oh love

Always, I want to be with you
And make believe with you
And live in harmony, harmony oh love
