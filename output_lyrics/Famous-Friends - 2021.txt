For single-season touchdown throws
And good ol' Johnny, he's the life of every party
It's like
Cheers
, they know him everywhere he goes

I've got some famous friends you've probably never heard of
But back in Rutherford County, our crowd is second to none
You might not know 'em here in this big city we're in
But when I go back home, I've got some famous friends
Yeah, I do

My buddy Jason, he's the sheriff
He'll flash his lights, but lеt me go
My boy Randy, he's a preachеr
My girl Megan, she's been teacher of the year
I swear for five years in a row

I've got some famous friends you've probably never heard of
But back in Hamilton County, our crowd is second to none
You might not know 'em here in this big city we're in
But when I go back home, I've got some famous friends
Yeah, I do

I got friends in high places
, on these small town roads
'Cause 'round here, it's all about the people that you know

You might not know 'em here in this big city we're in
But when I go back home, I've got some famous friends
Yeah, I do

(Ooh) Yeah, I do
Might not know 'em here in this big city we're in
But when I go back home, I've got some famous friends, yeah
