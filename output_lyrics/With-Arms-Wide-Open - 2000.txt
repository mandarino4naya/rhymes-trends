Well
angels
heard the news today
It seems my life is gonna change
I close my eyes, begin to pray
Then tears of joy streamed down my face
With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place
Ill show you everything
With arms wide open
With arms wide open
Well i dont know if im ready
To be the man i have to be
I take a breath i take her by my side
We stand in awe, we created life
With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place
Ill show you everything
With arms wide open
Now everything has changed
Ill show you love
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
With arms wide open

Ill show you everything
Oh yeah
With arms wide open
Wide open
If i just had one wish
Only one demand
I hope hes not like me
I hope he understands
That he can take his life
And hold it by the hand
And he can break the world
With arms wide open
With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place
Ill show you everything
With arms wide open
Now everything has changed
Ill show you love
Ill show you everything
With arms wide open
With arms wide open
Ill show you everything
Oh yeah
With arms wide open
Wide open
