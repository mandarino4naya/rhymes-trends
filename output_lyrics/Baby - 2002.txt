
Out with bro tryna slap shit
Astaghfirullah should've been in the Masjid

Bandzino's wrapped in Elastic
Wrap me a zoot and stuff it with Static

Out with bro tryna slap shit
Astaghfirullah should've been in the Masjid
Still gotta make pounds backflip
I'm making it back with a cream n tart
Bandzino's wrapped in Elastic
Wrap me a zoot and stuff it with Static
Turn this beef to a vegan
Fill him with corn and turn him cabbage

I feel like A in 2016
Only thing that's changed is bigger machines
And niggas change like the weather
I'm switching lanes and changing speed
I talk true , them niggas pussy's
Why you think that they hate on we
B-Brute, yeah that's brutal
Any time man stab up a neek
Lil' bro-bro just caught one on the mains
Had to laugh cause I'm on the same thing
Still with the same ones from back in the day
Only thing that has changed is bland new flames
W-W-We don't wait no Wraiths
We want brand new boots and lace
M-Move out the way
I'm with bro he'll shoot your face

A2Anti, Do man badly
Do that Gladly
Please don't mad me
Ride out , watch man natty
Deuce is home but it's still 3 [?]
Til it's backwards we go there
Cuz we want them in Backwoods
It was not me who crashed it
I am a rapper I'm not active
My slapper ain't got Snapchat
Slap that up for backchat
Light that up and ash that
No you can't get no zoot
You mad man
Clap that, do it like Mad-max
Or, turn for the bike and slap that
Let's see who's a badman
If you don't spot then circle, lap-back
