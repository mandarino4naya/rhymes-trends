
Ah
Mmm, yeah

Seems like ever since the first day we met
There is no one else I think of more than you
Can't seem to forget, can't get you out my head
Guess the verdict's in, I'm crazy over you
How can one be down? Tell me where to start
'Cause every time you smile, I feel tremors in my heart
I have but one concern: how can I get with you?
Till my day comes, here's what I'm gon' do, yeah

Be sittin' up in my room (Sittin' up in my room)
Back here thinking 'bout you (Thinking 'bout you)
I must confess, I'm a mess for you (I'm a mess for you)
Be sittin' up in my room (Sittin' up in my room)
Back here thinking 'bout you (Ooh, yes)
I'm just a mess with a thang for you

Pray that you'll invest in my happiness
All it takes is just one simple call from you
Turn my heart around if I'm making ground
Pretty baby, please tell me if I'm getting through
Tell me, what is up? You see, I need to know
Tell me if I'm far or if I'm getting close
I have but one concern, and that one concern is you
Till I'm wit' you, here's what I'm gon' do


Be sittin' up in my room (Sittin' up in my room)
Back here thinking 'bout you (Thinking 'bout you, yeah)
I must confess (I must confess), I'm a mess for you (I'm a mess for you)
Be sittin' up in my room (Sittin' up in my room, baby)
Back here thinking 'bout you (Thinking 'bout you)
I'm just a mess with a thang for you (Oh yeah)

Ooh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Mmm, mmm, oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, oh

How can one be down? Tell me where to start
'Cause every time you smile, I feel tremors in my heart
I have but one concern: how can I get with you?
Till my day comes, here's what I'm gonna do

Be sittin' up in my room
Back here thinking 'bout you (Gonna do, oh yeah)
I must confess, I'm a mess for you (I'm a mess for you)
Be sittin' up in my room (Baby, baby)
Back here thinking 'bout you (Oh yeah)
I'm just a mess with a thang for you (You know, I pray that you'll invest)
Be sittin' up in my room (In my happiness)
Back here thinking 'bout you (Turn my heart around)
I must confess (If I'm making ground), I'm a mess for you (Oh, tell me, what is up?)
Be sittin' up in my room (See, I need to know)
Back here thinking 'bout you (Tell me if I'm far)
I'm just a mess with a thang for you (Or if I'm getting close)
Be sittin' up in my room (Close, baby, ooh)
Back here thinking 'bout you (Come on, baby)
I must confess (I must confess), I'm a mess for you (I'm a mess for you, boy)
Be sittin' up in my room (Oh yeah)
Back here thinking 'bout you (Yeah, yeah)
I'm just a mess with a thang for you (You know, I pray that you'll invest)
Be sittin' up in my room (In my happiness)
Back here thinking 'bout you (So you turn my heart around)
I must confess (If I'm making ground), I'm a mess for you (Oh, tell me, what is up?)
Be sittin' up in my room (See, I need to know)
Back here thinking 'bout you (Tell me if I'm far)
I'm just a mess with a thang for you (Or if I'm getting close)
Be sittin' up in my room (Close)
Back here thinking 'bout you
I must confess, I'm a mess for you (I'm a mess for you, boy)
Be sittin' up in my room (Sittin' up in my room)
Back here thinking 'bout you (Ooh)
I'm just a mess with a thang for you
