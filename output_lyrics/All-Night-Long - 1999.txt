
I like this right here, yeah
Bad Boy, and we won't stop
Faith, '99

We can dance, dance, dance (all)
Clap your hands, hands, hands (night)
All night long
If you're in the mood (all)
Do what you wanna do (night)
All night long

Happy days are here
So leave your cares behind
Just relax your mind
It's so easy to do it

Just enjoy  yourself
If the feeling's right
Get your groove on tonight
Take your time tonight
Everything's all right
Ain't nothing but a party


We can dance, dance, dance (all)
Clap your hands, hands, hands (night)
All night long
If you're in the mood (all)
Do what you wanna do (night)
All night long

Get up on the floor
Don't worry 'bout a thing
The rhythm's got you now
So come on, get into it

Just enjoy yourself
If the feeling's right
Get your groove on tonight
Take your time tonight
Everything's all right
Ain't nothing but a party

We can dance, dance, dance (all)
Clap your hands, hands, hands (night)
All night long
If you're in the mood (all)
Do what you wanna do (night)
All night long


Have a good time
Lay back, relax
Just free your mind
Let the music take control of you
[Verse 3: Puffy and
Faith Evans
]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If it's a hot then I must've did it
If it's not then I wasn't with it
Bad Boy stay committed (Come on)
Whether hip-hop or R&B
Featuring Faith Evans, co-starring me, P. Diddy
(That's right)
You know I got the key to your city (I got the key)
Unlock the door, yeah, rock some more, yeah
Beats we lace
Bad Boy heat the place
We run R&B too 'cause we keep the faith (That's right)
Givin' the streets a taste
Blaze the charts (
I remember
)
In case you forgot
First Lady B making it hot (Making it hot)
Ain't nobody taking the spot (Nobody)
Now it's Faith instead of pain (That's right, come on)
Coming through with a better grain (That's right)
In the dash, cell phone better range (Come on)
Get the cash, and stock paper for the whole four quarters
Damn, some things never change
Ya feel me? (Yeah, you feel me?)
Let's make 'em dance
Come on, let's go


We can dance, dance, dance (DJ just play this song)
Clap your hands, hands, hands (Night)
All night long
If you're in the mood (All)
Do what you wanna do
All night long

Have a good time
Lay back, relax
Free, just free your mind
Let the music take control of you

We can dance, dance, dance (All night)
Clap your hands, hands, hands (All night)
All night long
If you're in the mood (All)
Do what you wanna do (Night)
All night long (DJ play our song)
