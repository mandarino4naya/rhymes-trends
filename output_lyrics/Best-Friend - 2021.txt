[Chorus: Doja Cat &
Saweetie

That's my best friend, she a real bad bitch
Got her own money, she don't need no nig'
On the dance floor, she had two, three drinks
Now she twerkin', she throw it out and come back in
That's my best friend, she a real bad bitch
Drive her own car (Alright),
she don't need no Lyft
In the strip club (Oh yeah), know my girl gon' tip
Now she twerkin' (Huh), she throw it out and come back in (Ha)

Beep-beep, is that my bestie in a Tessie?
Fresh blow out, skin on ten, ooh, she ready
Bitch, you look goodt, with a T at the end
I'ma hype her every time, that my mothеrfuckin' friend
She been down since thе jellies and the bobos
Now we steppin' out the G in Manolos
When we pull up to the scene, they be filled with jealousy
If a bitch get finicky, she gon' bring that energy (Pop-pop-pop)
I hit her phone with the tea, like, "Bitch, guess what?
All the rich-ass boys wanna fuck on us"
All this ass sittin' up, you could look, don't touch
And I'm bad bussin' bands every time we link up

That's my best friend, if you need a freak
I ain't dumb, but motherfucker, she my Tweedledee
If she ride for me (Ride), she don't need a key
If you sideways, she'll straighten you if needed be
And she so bad that I just can't take that bitch nowhere
She off her fifth shot, said, "Mm-mm, don't go there"
Bitch, break her back, she protect and attack
Get that strap like them buckle, foot on neck, give no air
Whole world wanna be us
And my main bitch, she my day-one
On my way, bitch, let you get drunk
And celebrate 'cause we the baddest in the club
