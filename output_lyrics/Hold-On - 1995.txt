
I don't wanna see you ever sad
Everything that I've got, you can have
When it's all too much, you need some human touch
To see it's really not so bad

Did you call on every saint you know
But still you feel like you're on your own?
Can you see through your tears I will always be here
And you're not out there, baby, all alone?

Hold on, 'til you feel a little stronger
Hold on to me, yeah, and I said
Hold on, everything's gonna be all right
Just hold on to me tonight

Anything that hurts you hurts me, too
And I'm not gonna let your world turn blue
Will you take my hand and feel how close I am?
There ain't nothin' I won't do for you, come on, now

Hold on, 'til you feel a little stronger
Hold on to me, yeah, and I said
Hold on, everything's gonna be all right
Just hold on to me tonight


I know the world can drive you to your knees
But when you need to cry, baby, cry to me, yeah

Hold on, 'til you feel a little stronger, yeah
Hold on to me, yeah, yeah, I said now
Hold on, everything's gonna be all right
Just hold on to me tonight, yeah

Just hold on to me tonight
