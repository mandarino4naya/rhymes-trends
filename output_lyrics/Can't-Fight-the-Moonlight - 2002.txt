
Under a lover's sky, gonna be with you
And no one's gonna be around
If you think that you won't fall, well, just wait until
'Til the sun goes down

Underneath the starlight, starlight
There's a magical feelin', so right
It'll steal your heart tonight

You can try to resist, try to hide from my kiss
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark, you'll surrender your heart
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight, no, you can't fight it
It's gonna get to your heart

There's no escapin' love once a gentle breeze (Once a gentle breeze)
Weaves its spell upon your heart
No matter what you think, it won't be too long (Not too long)
'Til you're in my arms


Underneath the starlight, starlight
We'll be lost in the rhythm, so right
Feel it steal your heart tonight

You can try to resist, try to hide from my kiss
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark, you'll surrender your heart
But you know, but you know that you (Can't)
Can't fight the moonlight, no, you can't fight it (No)
No (No) matter what you do
The night is gonna get to you

(Never know, cannot know)
Don't try, you're never gonna win, oh

Underneath the starlight, starlight
There's a magical feelin', so right
It will steal your heart tonight

You can try (You can try to resist, try to hide from my kiss)
(But you know) But you know that you (You know that you)
Can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark (Deep in the dark), you'll surrender your heart
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight, no, you can't fight it
(You can try to resist, try to hide from my kiss) You can try to resist my kiss
(But you know) Don't you know that you can't
Can't fight the moonlight?
Deep in the dark, you'll surrender your heart (Surrender your heart)
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight, no, you can't fight it
It's gonna get to your heart
