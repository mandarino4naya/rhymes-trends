In the still...of the night
I held you...held you tight
I love...love you so
Promise I'll never...let you go
In the still...of the night
(In the still of the night)
I remember (I remember) that night in May
The stars were bright above
I'll hope...and I'll pray
To keep...your precious love
So before...the light
Hold me again
With all of your might
In the still...of the night
(In the still of the night)
So before...the light
Hold me again...with all of your might
In the still...of the night
(In the still of the night)
In the still of the night
