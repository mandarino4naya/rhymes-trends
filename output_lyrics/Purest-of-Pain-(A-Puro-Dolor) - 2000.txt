
I'm sorry I didn't mean to call you
But I couldn't fight it
I guess I was weak and couldn't even hide it
And so I surrender just to hear your voice
I know how many times I said I'm gonna to live without you
And maybe someone else is standing there beside you
But there's something baby that you need to know

That deep inside me, I feel like I'm dying
I have to see you, it's all that I'm asking

Vida, give me back my fantasies
The courage that I need to live
The air that I breathe
Cariño mío, my world's become so empty
My days are so cold and lonely
And each night I taste the purest of pain

I wish I can tell you that I'm feeling better everyday
That I didn't hurt when you walked away
But to tell you the truth I can't fine my way


That deep inside me, I feel like I'm dying
I have to see you, it's all that I'm asking

Vida, give me back my fantasies
The courage that I need to live
The air that I breathe
Cariño mío, my world's become so empty
My days are so cold and lonely
And each night I taste the purest of pain
Vida, give me back my fantasies
The courage that I need to live
The air that I breathe
Cariño mío, my world's become so empty
My days are so cold and lonely
And each night I taste the purest of pain
Vida, give me back my fantasies
The courage that I need to live
The air that I breathe
Cariño mío, my world's become so empty
My days are so cold and lonely
And each night I taste the purest of pain


I'm sorry I didn't mean to call you
But I couldn't fight it
I guess I was weak and couldn't even hide it
And so I surrender just to hear your voice
