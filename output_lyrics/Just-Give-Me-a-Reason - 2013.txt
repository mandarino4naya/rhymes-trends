
Right from the start
You were a thief, you stole my heart
And I, your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch, you fixed them

Now you've been talkin' in your sleep, oh, oh
Things you never say to me, oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough of our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
[Verse 2: Nate Ruess,
P!nk
]
I'm sorry I don't understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
Oh, we had everything
Your head is runnin' wild again
My dear, we still have everythin'
And it's all in your mind
Yeah, but this is happenin'

[Pre-Chorus: Nate Ruess,
P!nk & Nate Ruess
,
P!nk
]
You've been havin' real bad dreams, oh, oh
You used to lie so close to me, oh, oh
There's
nothin' more than empty sheets between our love, our love
Oh, our
love, our love
,
love
[Chorus: P!nk & Nate Ruess,
Nate Ruess
]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
I never stopped
You're still written in the scars on my heart
You're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
[Bridge: P!nk,
Nate Ruess
]
Oh, tears ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust
But our love's enough
You're holdin' it in
You're pourin' a drink
No, nothin' is as bad as it seems
We'll come clean


Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's still written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

Oh, we can learn to love again
Oh, can learn to love again
Oh, that we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
