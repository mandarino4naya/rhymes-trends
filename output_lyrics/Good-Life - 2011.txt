
Woke up in London yesterday
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone
New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night, night turns to whatever we want
We're young enough to say

Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This has gotta be a good life
A good, good life

Listen, to my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A., they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado
Sometimes there's airplanes you can't jump out
Sometimes bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories, but please tell me
What's there to complain about?


When you're happy like a fool
You let it take you over
When everything is out
You gotta take it in

Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This has gotta be a good life
A good, good life, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, a good, good life
Woo-hoo-hoo
Oh-oh, yeah

Hopelessly, I feel like there might be something that I'll miss
Hopelessly, I feel like the window closes oh so quick
Hopelessly, I'm taking a mental picture of you now
'Cause hopelessly, the hope is we have
So much to feel good about, yeah

Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This has gotta be the good life
It's a good, good life


Oh, yeah
La, la, oh
It's a good, good life, ooh
Ooh, yeah
Listen, to my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A., they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado
Sometimes there's airplanes you can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories, but please tell me
What's there to complain about?

It's a good, good life
Good, good life
Good good life
