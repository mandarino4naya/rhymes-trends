[Verse 1: John Mellencamp &
Meshell Ndegéocello
]
As you brush your shoes and stand before your mirror
And you comb your hair and grab your coat and hat
And you walk the streets trying to
remember
, yeah
All those wild nights breeze through your mind
[Chorus: John Mellencamp,
Both
]
And everything looks so complete
When you're walking out on the streets
And the wind catches your feet
And sends you flying, crying
Ooh, ooh-ooh wee
The wild night is calling
[Verse 2: John Mellencamp &
Meshell Ndegéocello
]
All the girls walk by dressed up for each other
And the boys do the boogie-woogie on the corner of the street
And the people passing by just stare with the wild wonder, yeah
And the inside jukebox roars just like thunder
[Chorus:
Meshell Ndegéocello
,
Both
]
And everything looks so complete
When you're walking out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
And sends you flying
, crying
Ooh, ooh-ooh wee
The wild night is calling


[Bridge: John Mellencamp &
Meshell Ndegéocello
]
Wild night is calling
The wild night is calling
Come on out and dance
Come on out and dance
Come on out and make romance
Come on out and dance
Come on out and dance
Come on out and make romance
[Chorus: John Mellencamp,
Both
]
And everything looks so complete
When you're walking out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
And sends you flying, crying
Ooh, ooh-ooh wee
The wild night is calling
Ooh, ooh-ooh wee
The wild night is calling
