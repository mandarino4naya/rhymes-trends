
Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancin'
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are takin' over
Sweet dreams of dancin' through the night

I wanna get into motion, a better devotion
So I can make it through the night
So the music is playin', you know what I'm sayin'
Now everything will be alright

Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancin'
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are takin' over
Sweet dreams of dancin' through the night (Oh-oh, oh)

Ola ola eh, ola ola eh
Ola ola eh, ola ola eh

Rhythm is a creation, a better sensation
That will lead you through the night
When your body is movin', the music is groovin'
I wanna take you home tonight


Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancin'
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are takin' over
Sweet dreams of dancin' through the night (Oh-oh, oh)

Ola ola eh, ola ola eh
Ola ola eh, ola ola eh

Keep dancin' hard
Give this groove more feeling
Dance, trance, dance, more dealing
In, out, up, down, all around
On the dance floor gettin' down
Take time just to show them who
We can make your body move
Totally, yes, the party's started
Sweet dreams keep comin' harder

Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancin'
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are takin' over
Sweet dreams of dancin' through the night
Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancin'
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are takin' over
Sweet dreams of dancin' through the night (Oh-oh, oh)


Ola ola eh, ola ola eh
Ola ola eh, ola ola eh...
