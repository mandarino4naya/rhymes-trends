
Girl, I know I don't know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pullin' me in
Like the moon on your skin
I'm so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
And get out of town

Got the stars comin' out over my hood
And all I know now is it's going good

You got your hands up
You're rockin' in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singin' every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losin' hold
Of everything I've got
You're looking so damn hot

And I don't know what road we're on
Or where we've been
From starin' at you, girl
All I know is I don't want this night to end


Gonna cuss the mornin' when it comes
'Cause I know that the risin' sun
Ain’t no good for me
'Cause you'll have to leave
Gonna make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss

Clock on the dash says 3:35
There's plenty of gas, and the night's still alive

You got your hands up
You’re rockin' in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singin' every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losin' hold
Of everything I've got
You're looking so damn hot

And I don't know what road we're on
Or where we've been
From starin' at you, girl
All I know is I don't want this night to end



You got your hands up
You're rockin' in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singin' every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losin' hold
Of everything I've got
You're looking so damn hot

And I don't know what road we're on
Or where we've been
From starin' at you, girl
All I know is I don't want this night to end

I don't want this night to end
No, I don’t want this night to end
