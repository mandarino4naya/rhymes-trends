Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop

When the sun goes down, down, down, down
Boy, are you afraid of the dark, dark?
And when the lights go out, out, out, out
Tell me, do you know where it starts, start?
And when the bass gets loud, loud, loud
That is when I feel apart, ah
And when the world sleeps sound, sound, sound
Well, the sound is the key to my heart, heart


We run, yes, we run the night
Ni-night, night-ight-ight-ight-ight-ight-ight
Ight-ight-ight-ight-ight-ight-ight-ight
I-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-ight

We run, yes
We run the night
We-we-we run
We-we-we run, run
We run, yes
We run the night, the night

Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop

From the bottom of the map (Miami)
To the land down under (Australia)
You feel my draft,
see my vision, and hear my hunger (My hunger)
As my money gets older (Older)
Their's get younger (Younger)
They sell their soul, but the devil knows I have no number
I'm global, baby (Hey)
Official, baby (Hey)
Go, go, baby (Hey)
Oh, oh, baby (Hey)
No, no, baby (Hey)
Yeah, yeah, baby (Hey)
Now jiggle it, baby
Let me tickle it, baby
I know I'm lost, it's gonna be hard to save me
I'm sorry, that's how Dade County raised me
Ya heard me, right? We run the night
Now fuck you, pay me (Woo!)


We run, yes, we run the night
Ni-night, night-ight-ight-ight-ight-ight-ight
Ight-ight-ight-ight-ight-ight-ight-ight
I-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-ight

We run, yes
We run the night
We-we-we run
We-we-we run, run
We run, yes
We run the night, the night

Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop

Feeling like a rush, rush, rush
Pushing past me, all over my skin, ski-i-i-i-i-in
I can't get enough-nough-nough
'Cause the beat keep pullin' me in (
In
)
Takin' me so high up, up, up
A place that I've never been, ah
Party, party all night, night, night
Sleep all day, then do it again, 'gain


We run, yes
We run the night (We run the night)
Ni-night, night (The night)
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop

We run, yes
We run the night
We-we-we run
We-we-we run, run
We run, yes
We run the night, the night

Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop
