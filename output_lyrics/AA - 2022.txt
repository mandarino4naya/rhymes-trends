One, two, three

Alright
Coffee cup, cold and black
Wish you had a little shot of jack
Besides that, can't complain
Just tryin' to do the dang thing
Might change the oil in my truck
I ain't payin' no thirty-five bucks
Kids need shoes, mama needs Levi's

And I'm just tryna keep my daughters off the pole
And my sons out of jail
Tryna get to church so I don't go to hell
I'm just tryna keep my wife from figuring out
That I married up and she married way, way down
In Alabama where they love Nick Saban
Tryna write a song the local country station will play
Hey, I'm just tryna stay out of AA (AA, ooh)

Well I gave up
Skoal
and cigarettes
Now I'm just hooked on Nicorette
Trying not to be like my old man
But the older I get, the more I am
Tryna get paid and a little love made, y'all
Hey, y'all, at the end of the day, y'all
I'm just another John Deere guy (Hey)
Up on a tractor

Tryna steer my daughters off the pole
And my sons out of jail (Sons out of jail)
Tryna get to church so I don't go to hell (I don't wanna go)
I'm just tryna keep my wife (Hey babe) from figuring out (I love you)
That I married up (So fine girl) and she married way way down
In Alabama where they love Nick Saban (Roll tide)
Tryna write a song the local country station will play
Hey, I'm just tryna stay out of AA
(Ooh, ooh, come on, babe, right here)

Tell you, ooh-ooh-ooh, tryna stay out of AA every day
One step at a time,
yeah
Life's hard,
family's weird
Sometimes you just need a beer
Can I get an Amen? (Amen)

Man, I'm just tryna keep my daughters off the pole
And my sons out of jail (Sons out of jail)
Tryna get to church so I don't go to hell (I don't wanna go)
I'm just tryna keep my wife (Hey babe) from figuring out (I love you)
That I married up (So fine girl) and she married way way down
In Alabama where they love Nick Saban (Roll Tide)
Tryna write a song the local country station will play


Hey, I'm just tryna stay out of AA
Oh, hey, hey, hey, I'm just tryna stay out of AA
Yes, I am
