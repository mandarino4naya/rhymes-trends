
Ooh, girl, I like you, I do
I wanna be your friend, go shoppin' in a Benz
I like you, I do
I'll hit you when I land, can you fit me in your plans?
I like you, I do
We went to bed in France, then we woke up in Japan
I like you, I do (I do, mm)

Oh, girl, I know you only like it fancy (Fancy)
So, I pull up in that Maybach Candy
Yeah, your boyfriend'll never understand me (Understand)
'Cause I'm 'bout to pull his girl like a hammy, hammy (Wow)
Let's take a lil' dip, lil' lady, hit PCH, 180
Hey, I've been thinkin' lately
That I need someone to save me
Now that I'm famous, I got **** all around me
But I need a good girl, I need someone to ground me
So, please be truе, don't **** around with me
I need someone to sharе this heart with me
Fill you up, then run it back again (Run it back again)

Ooh, girl, I like you, I do (I do)
I wanna be your friend, go shoppin' in a Benz (Woo)
I like you, I do (I do)
I'll hit you when I land, can you fit me in your plans?
I like you, I do (I do)
We went to bed in France, then we woke up in Japan
I like you, I do (Mm, mm, I do)


Let me know when you're free
'Cause I been tryna hit it all week, babe
Why you actin' all sweet?
I know that you want little ol' me
I get a little OD, but ain't **** new to a freak
Let me drop bands, put a jewel in ya teeth
He love the way I drip, turn that pool to the beach
And I coulda copped a Birkin but I cop Celine
Why we got the same taste for the finer things?
Brand new **** with the same old team
Now he got me on a leash 'cause he said no strings
You know I'm cool with that
Stole the ****, you ain't get sued for that (Get sued, sued)
Wonder what a **** might do for that (Do, might do)
I could be your Chaka, where Rufus at? (Where?)
80 in the Benz when that roof go back, ayy
They don't wanna see us get too attached
I just got a feelin' that we might be friends for a long, long time
You don't mind and you know I like you for that
