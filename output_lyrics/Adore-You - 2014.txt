Oh-oh, oh-oh
Hey
Oh, oh, mm

Baby, baby, yeah
Are you listenin'?
Wonderin' where you've been
All my life
I just started livin'
Ooh, oh, baby
Are you listenin'? Oh-oh

When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

Baby, can you hear me
When I'm cryin' out for you?
I'm scared, oh, so scared
But when you're near me, uh
I feel like I'm standin' with an army
Of men armed with weapons
Hey, oh

When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

I love lyin' next to you
I could do this for eternity
You and me
We're meant to be in holy matrimony
God knew exactly what He was doin'
When He led me to you

When you say you love me
Know I love you more (I love you more)
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
