
We, like the breeze, flow straight out of our lids
Them, they got moved by these hard-rock Brooklyn kids
Us, floor rush when the DJ's booming classics
You dig the crew on the fattest hip-hop record
He touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds
She frequents the fattest joints caught underground
Our funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane
They flock to booms, man, boogie had to change
Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion?
Where kinky hair goes, to unthought-of dimensions
Why's it so fly? 'Cause hip-hop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked the light blue suede Pumas
What by the cut, we push it off the corner
How was the buzz, entire hip-hop era
Was fresh and fat since they started saying outtie
'Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie
The poobah of the styles like Miles and shit
Like
sixties funky worms
with
waves and perms
Just sendin' junky rhythms right down your block
We be to rap what key be to lock

But
I'm cool like that
I'm cool like that
I'm cool like that
I'm cool like that
I'm cool like that
I'm cool like that
I'm cool like that
I'm cool

[Verse 2: Ladybug &
Butterfly

We be the chocolates taps on my raps
She innovates at the sweeter cat naps
He at the funk club with the vibrate
Them, they be crazy down with the five Nat'
It can kick a plan then a crowd burst
Me, I be digging it with the Bug verse
Us, we be freaking 'til dawn blinks an eye
He gives the strangest smile, so I say, "Hi" (
What's up?
)
Who understood? Yeah, understood the plans
Him, heard a beat and put it to his hands
What I just flip, let borders get loose
How to consume all the beats just like juice
If it's the shit, we'll lift it off the plastic
The babes'll go spastic
,
hip-hop gains a classic
Pimp playing shock, it don't matter, I'm fatter
Ask Butter how I zone (
Man, Cleopatra Jones
)

And I'm chill like that
I'm chill like that
I'm chill like that
I'm chill like that
I'm chill like that
I'm chill like that
I'm chill like that
I'm chill


Blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink
Think, think, think, think, think, think, think

We get you free 'cause the clips be fat, boss
Them, they're the jams and commence to going off
She sweats the beats and asks me could she puff it
Me, I got crew, kid,
seven and a crescent
Us cause a buzz when the nickel bags are dealt
Him, that's my man with the asteroid belt
They catch a fizz from the Mr. Doodle-big
He rocks a tee from the Crooklyn nine-pigs
The rebirth of slick like my gangster stroll
The lyrics, just like loot, come in stacks and rolls
You used to find a Bug in a box with fade
Now he boogies up your stage, plaits, twists, or braids

And I'm peace like that
I'm peace like that
I'm peace like that
I'm peace like that
I'm peace like that
I'm peace like that
I'm peace like that
I'm peace

[Outro: Butterfly,
Ladybug
, and
Doodlebug
]
Check it out, man, I groove like that
I'm smooth like that
I jive like that
I roll like that
Yeah, I'm thick like that
I stack like that
I'm down like that
I'm black like that
Well, yo, I funk like that
I'm phat like that
I'm in like that
'Cause I swing like that
We jazz like that
We freak like that
We zoom like that
We out
