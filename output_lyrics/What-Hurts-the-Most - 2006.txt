
I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let 'em out
I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay
But that’s not what gets me

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowin’
What could've been
And not seein' that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do

It’s hard to deal with the pain of losin' you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ it
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still harder gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin' with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart (Trade it)
That I left unspoken


What hurts the most
Is being so close
And havin' so much to say (Much to say)
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowin'
What could've been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do, oh

Oh, yeah
Woo

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say (Much to say)
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowin'
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do

Not seeing that loving you
That’s what I was trying to do
Ooh
