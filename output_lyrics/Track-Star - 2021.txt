
Yeah
Man, I ain't, I ain't ever had this happen before, man (I ain't ever had this happen before)
(My heart is breaking) Heart breaks so deep
Heart broke so deep, it broke into a melody like this
My heart is breaking, my heart is—, my heart is aching
Hey, ayy, ayy

She's a runner, she's a track star
She gon' run away when it gets hard
She can't take the pain, she can't get scarred
She hurt anyone that gets involved
Don't wanna commit, why take it this far (Oh why?)
Shе gon' do the race, just not this one (Oh why?)
Lovе is a game, you used to cheer for
When I was down to talk, you weren't here for it
You-ouu-ouu-ouu-ouu (Ooh)
Leave a trail of heartbreak and heartache like its cool (Ooh)
I guess way too late is convenient for you (Ooh)
The dirt you left don't turn into dust, it don't move (Ooh)
It's here waiting for you (Ooh)

Girl, you killing me, you tweakin' hard (Girl, you tweakin')
I asked you what you feel and you don't speak at all (Oh no)
But you go straight to Twitter, you gon' tweet it all (Oh why?)
You must want another nigga to be alarmed (What you want see?)
We were 'posed to fight through the storm
You made a decision, chose the easy one
Say you following your heart, but girl you leaving one
Wanting me to take you back with open reaching arms (And I can't do that, mama)


I-I-I-I-I I'm
Lost for words, let it hurt
(Setting my heart on fire, setting my heart on fire)
I-I-I-I-I
Put you first, showed you your worth
(Gave you whatever you desire, gave you whatever you desire)

She run from all of her problems like she in shape for it (Oh)
Hard times, wait for it and then she break for it (And then she break, yeah)
Love don't cost a thing, ashamed how much I paid for it (I'm ashamed)
Love don't cost a thing ashamed how much I gave for it
Heart broken into pieces put tape on it (Woah-woah)
Fragile made out of glass, close the drapes on it (Woah-woah)
Trust issues so deep playing safe on it (Woah-woah)
Will I ever love again or will I stay lonely?


I-I-I-I-I I'm
Lost for words, let it hurt
(Setting my heart on fire, setting my heart on fire)
I-I-I-I-I
Put you first, showed you your worth
(Gave you whatever you desire, gave you whatever you desire)

(She's a runner, runner, runner, runner, runner, runner)
She can't take it, she can't take it
Oh-oh, yeah
