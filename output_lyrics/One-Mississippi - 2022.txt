
You and I
Had this off and on so long
You've been here, then you've been gone
So many times
And every night
Yeah, I'm always bumpin' into you
We do the same things we used to
It's your place or it's mine, so

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Well, I swear we're through with the lonely drunk and déjà vu
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Five minutes out of downtown
Ain't nothin' but a countdown

One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three shots of whiskey
Are you on your way?
Way tipsy, baby, come kiss me, I can't wait, I can't wait
Mississippi, two Mississippi, three in the mornin'
We'll be on our way
So tipsy, can't stop kissin', I can't wait, I can't wait forever

Mm, every time I'm at this bar, tap on the shoulder, turn around
And baby, there you are
And it's fire, you're like this Bourbon, hundred proof
Yeah, they don't burn the way you do
Yeah, we're better in the dark, so


Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Well, I swear we're through with the lonely drunk and déjà vu
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Five minutes out of downtown
Ain't nothin' but a countdown

One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three shots of whiskey
Are you on your way?
Way tipsy, baby, come kiss me, I can't wait, I can't wait
Mississippi, two Mississippi, three in the mornin'
We'll be on our way
So tipsy, can't stop kissin', I can't wait, I can't wait forever

Hey

Kinda like that Georgia wind
We'll be gone and back again
But always wind up right back where we are
Playin' roulette with our hearts
And blowin' smoke rings in the dark, yeah

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Well, I swear we're through with the lonely drunk and déjà vu
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Five minutes out of downtown
Ain't nothin' but a countdown


One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three shots of whiskey
Are you on your way?
Way tipsy, baby, come kiss me, I can't wait, I can't wait
Mississippi, two Mississippi, three in the mornin'
We'll be on our way
So tipsy, can't stop kissin', I can't wait, I can't wait forever

Every time I'm at this bar, tap on the shoulder, turn around
And baby, there you are
