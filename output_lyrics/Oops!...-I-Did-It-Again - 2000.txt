
I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends
Oh, baby
It might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious
'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh, baby, baby
Oops, I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

You see my problem is this
I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes, they truly exist
I cry, watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways
But to lose all my senses


That is just so typically me
Oh baby, baby

Oops, I did it again
(Oops, I)
I played with your heart
(Did it again with your heart)
Got lost in the game
(Got lost in this game)
Oh baby, baby
(Oh baby)
Oops, you think I'm in love
(Oops, you)
That I'm sent from above
(Think that I'm sent from above)

I'm not that innocent
You're not that innocent
