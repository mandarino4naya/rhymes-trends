
Whenever I'm down
I call on you, my friend
A helping hand you lend
In my time of need, so I
I'm calling you now
Just to make it through
What else can I do?
Don't you hear my plea?

Friends may come and friends may go
But you should know that
That I've got your back, it's automatic
So, never hesitate to call
'Cause I'm your sister and always for ya
And I

Don't know what I'd ever do without you
From the beginning till the end (Ooh)
You've always been here right beside me (Hey, oh yeah)
So I'll call you my best friend (Ooh, oh yeah)
Through the good times and the bad ones
Whether I lose or if I win
I know one thing that never changes
And that's you as my best friend (Oh yeah)


Whenever I'm done
And all that's goin' on
It's really goin' wrong
Just one of those days, and ya
You say the right things
To keep me movin' on
To keep me goin' strong
What else can I say?

Friends are there through thick and thin
Well, I've been told that
And I believe that it's automatic
Call me when you need a friend
'Cause I'm your sister and always for ya
And I don't know

Don't know what I'd ever do without you (Hey, oh)
From the beginning till the end
You've always been here right beside me (You'll always be)
So I'll call you my best friend (My best friend, oh)
Through the good times and the bad ones
Whether I lose or if I win (Lose or if I win)
I know one thing that never changes
And that's you as my best friend (I don't know, I don't know)
Don't know what I'd ever do without you
From the beginning till the end (Till the end)
You've always been here right beside me (Oh, oh)
So I'll call you my best friend (Oh)
Through the good times and the bad ones (Good times and the bad ones)
Whether I lose or if I win
I know one thing that never changes (Hey, oh yeah)
And that's you as my best friend (Ooh, yeah)


Don't know what I'd ever do
So, I call on my best friend
Dum-dway, dum-dah-dah, dum-dway, dum-dah-dah

Don't know what I'd ever do (Hey)
So, I call on my best friend
Day, dum-dah, doo-dah, ooh-no-no, don't know
