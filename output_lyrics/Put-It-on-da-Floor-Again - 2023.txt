Rip me out the plastic, I been actin' brand new
Bitches actin' like they runnin' shit, they really ran through
I'll spend that five hundred 'fore I ever trap you
They thought I was gon' fall off, I hate to bring you bad news
Threw so many racks, a bitch can't even see the floor
From Atlanta to L.A.
, the only time I'm back and forth
Cheap niggas make you pick, rich niggas get you both
Gave the Bentley to valet and let that nigga drive the boat
Shh, be quiet (Be quiet), lеt me pop off
Leave thе club sloppy drunk, come home and get my rocks off
Heard "Bitch from Da Souf," he tryna see me knock his socks off
Told them bitches, "Meet me at the top," think they got lost
Tuh, I'm on go like Grizz
She thought I would kiss her ass, she must ain't took her meds, tuh
Shit around my neck, it cost a arm and leg
Swear that nigga set for life, I let him get me preg'

I done done it all (Tuh), feel like Shawty Lo (Tuh)
Laughin' to the bank (Tuh), but shit is not a joke (Tuh)
Say she got a problem (Tuh), imaginary smoke (Tuh)
Bitches said it's up (Tuh), then put it on the floor (Tuh)
I done done it all (Tuh), feel like Shawty Lo (Tuh)
Laughin' to the bank (Tuh), but shit is not a joke (Tuh)
Say she got a problem (Tuh), imaginary smoke (Tuh)
Bitches said it's up (Tuh), then put it on the floor (Tuh)


I don't know what y'all been told (Told)
Bet yo' mans know, if you don't, what's happenin'?

Put a ribbon on me, I been actin' brand new
I ain't smokin' on no za, lil' bitch, I'm smokin' on you
Put your bestie in a pack and now I'm smokin' her too
I been ballin' so damn hard, could've went to LSU, huh
Got so many chains on, I can't even see my throat
These hoes don't do enough,
that's why I always do the most
Broke niggas give the dick, rich niggas sponsor
goals
Only thing a nigga get from me for free is free the bros
Let me pop it off
Point me to the biggest slut, baby girl, come top it off
She said she don't like me 'cause she love me, duh, knock it off
That bitch made ten pages just to sub me, but I block 'em all
All these hoes is mid
Got her lurkin' on my page before she feed her kids, huh
Shittin' on these bitches, dunkin' on they heads
Get these hoes some melatonin, put they ass to bed (Bitch)
Nigga, cry for what? Bitch, these are Denim Tears (Huh)
I'm sexy dancin' in the house, I feel like Britney Spears
So put it on the floor, just like they career
What they got on me? Bodies and a couple years


I done done it all (Tuh), feel like Shawty Lo (Shawty Lo)
Laughin' to the bank (Tuh), but shit is not a joke (Not a joke)
Say she got a problem (Tuh), imaginary smoke (Brr)
Bitches said it's up, then put it on the floor
(Pew, pew)

I don't know what y'all been told (Told)
Bet yo' mans know, if you don't, what's happenin'?

Yeah, it's giving cunt
I'm in the booth playin' with my pussy, bitch, ha
Big Latto, big Bardi, it's a real bitch party
Put it on the floor again, bitch
