
Empty spaces fill me up with holes
Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you, within me, I can't find no rest
Where I'm going, is anybody's guess
[Chorus: Nick
with Howie
]
I tried
to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake,
but my world is half asleep
I pray
for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is
Incomplete
[Verse 2: AJ
with Howie
&
All
]
Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming
in an ocean all alone
Baby,
my baby, it's written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake
[Chorus: Nick with Howie,
All
]
I tried
to go on like I never knew you
I’m awake
, but my world is half asleep
I pray
for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is
Incomplete

[Bridge: AJ &
All
]
I don't mean to drag it on
But I can't seem to let you go
I don't wanna make you face this world alone
I wanna let you go
(Alone, oh-oh-oh-oh)
[Chorus: Nick with Howie,
AJ
&
All
]
I tried
to go on like I never knew you
I’m awake
, but my world is half asleep
I pray
for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is
(Going to be is)

Incomplete
Incomplete
