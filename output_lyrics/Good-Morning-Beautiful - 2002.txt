
Good morning beautiful
How was your night?
Mine was wonderful
With you by my side
And when I opened my eyes
And see your sweet face
Its a good morning beautiful day

I couldn't see the light
I didn't know day from night
I had no reason to care
Well since you came along
I can face the dawn
Cause I know you'll be there

Good morning beautiful
How was your night?
Mine was wonderful
With you by my side
And when I opened my eyes
And see your sweet face
It's a
Good morning beautiful day


I never worry
If it's raining outside
Cause in here with you girl
The sun always shines

Good morning beautiful
How was your night?
Mine was wonderful
With you by my side
And when I opened my eyes
And see your sweet face
Its a good morning beautiful day-ay

Mmm, good morning beautiful
Day

Mmm
(Good morning beautiful)
It's a beautiful day
(Good morning beautiful)
Good morning
(Good morning beautiful)
What a beautiful day
(Good morning beautiful)
