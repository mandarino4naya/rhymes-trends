
It's a beautiful day, she's been cryin' all night
Aw, there's tears in her blues, bloodshot in mine
This bender's been bendin', it's hell-bound to break
My baby's had all she can take

Mister, I'll take your roses
If you cut off the thorns, she can't take no more
I'll buy violets and daisies to hide all the crazy
It's gonna take all you've got
Aw, it's a bad day for love
But a good day for flower shops

Well, I took some pills and she took the dogs
Aw, it's all gone to hell, she's gone to her mom's
And I took up drinkin' since she took the time
To tell me I took the best years of her life

So, buddy, I'll take your roses
If you cut off the thorns, she can't take no more
I'll buy violets and daisies to hide all the crazy
It's gonna take all you've got
Yeah, it's a tough day for love
But a good day for flower shops


[Bridge: ERNEST,
Both
]
Roses are red, violets are blue
I don't need one, I need one million to...
to get you
[Chorus: ERNEST,
Morgan Wallen
,
Both
]
So, mister, I'll take your roses
If you cut off the thorns, she can't take no more
I'll buy violets and daisies to get back my baby
It's gonna take all you've got
Aw, it's a bad day for love
But a good day for flower shops
