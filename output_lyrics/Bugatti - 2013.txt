One hundred K, I spent that on my wrist
Two hundred dollars, spent that on your bitch
Do me a model, put that on my list

Killin' the scene, bring the coroner in
Murder she wrote, swallow or choke
Hit her and go home, won't call her again
Woke up early this mornin', crib as big as a college

Forty-two hundred my mortgage (Yeah)
Ballin' on niggas like Kobe (Yeah)
Fuck all you haters, you bore me (Woo)

Reppin' my city, I'm runnin' my state
Give me a pistol, then run with the K's
Niggas want beef, then I visit your place (Bang)

Countin' money, hourly trend
Rollin' them skinny like Olsen twins
Niggas is squares, coppin' a Benz
Neck full of gold, Olympian shit

Fall on some pussy, then hop on the Lear
Strapped with them choppers in back of the rear
Sak pase', them killers is here
Woke up early this mornin', mind is tellin' me money
Paper (Yeah), mula (Yeah), pockets is fat as a tumor
Millionaire nigga, no rumor, livin' my life off of tuna

Pull up a seat, bon app√©tit
No Louboutins when red on your sneaks (Bang)

Photographs of dope boys (I see 'em) is all they takin'
Finger prints on the Rolls Royce (Woo) is why they hatin'
Push a button on these broke boys (Skrrt), that's detonation
Walk a road to riches bare feet (Me)

That's why I hustle for half a key, that's twelve G's (G)
I'm tryin' to bubble every summer a new LP (Woo)
You gotta love me, I got shooters out the D-League (Woah)
Signin' bonus, hit that man that's from thirty feet (Woo)
Left in a puddle, finger prints is on a hundred mill' (Mill')
