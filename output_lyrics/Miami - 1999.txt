

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Miami, uh, uh
South Beach, bringin' the heat, uh
Ha-ha, can y'all feel that?
Can y'all feel that?
Jig it out, uh

Here I am, in the place where I come let go
In Miami the bass and the sunset low
Everyday like a Mardi Gras, everybody party all day
No work, all play
, okay?
So we sip a little something, leave the rest to spill
Me and Charlie at the bar, runnin' up a high bill
Nothin' less than ill, when we dress to kill
Every time the ladies pass, they be like,
"Hi, Will!"
Can y'all feel me? All ages and races
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Haitian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban, and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But every time I come I always wind up stayin'
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin'


Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami, bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
I'm goin' to Miami,
welcome to Miami

Yo, I heard the rainstorms ain't nothin' to mess with
But I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin' out, "Will, we loved your last hit!"
So I'm thinkin' I'ma scoop me somethin' hot
In this salsa-merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees
in the Caribbean seas
With the hot mamis screaming
"Â¡Ay, papi!"
Every time I come to town, they be spottin' me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin' me
So, cash in your dough and flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound, anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
And if you ask how I know, I got's to plead the fifth

Welcome to Miami, bienvenidos a Miami

I'm goin' to Miami,
welcome to Miami

Don't get me wrong, Chi-town got it goin' on
And New York is the city that we know don't sleep
And we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin' heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnamon tans
Mira, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimme your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jet skis, loungin' in the palm trees
'Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South Beach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, everybody got 'em
Ain't no surprise, in the club to see Sly Stallone
Miami, my second home (
Miami
