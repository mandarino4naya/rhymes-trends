
Ooh-ooh
Ooh

Everybody's got something
They had to leave behind
One regret from yesterday
That just seems to grow with time

There's no use looking back or wondering (Or wondering)
How it could be now or might have been (Or might have been)
All this I know, but still, I can't find ways to let you go

I never had a dream come true
Till the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say (Never found the words to say)
You're the one I think about each day (The one I think about each day)
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be with you, yeah

Somewhere in my memory
I've lost all sense of time (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
And tomorrow can never be
'Cause yesterday is all that fills my mind


There's no use looking back or wondering (Or wondering)
How it should be now or might have been (Or might have been)
All this I know, but still, I can't find ways to let you go

I never had a dream come true
Till the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say (Never found the words to say)
You're the one I think about each day (The one I think about each day)
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be

You'll always be the dream that fills my head
Yes, you will, say you will, you know you will, oh, baby
You'll always be the one I know I'll never forget

There's no use looking back or wondering (Or wondering)
Because love is a strange and funny thing (And funny thing)
No matter how I try and try (How I try), I just can't say goodbye
No, no, no, no


I've never had a dream come true
Till the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say (Never found the words to say)
You're the one I think about each day (The one I think about each day)
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be

A part of me will always be with you
Ooh
