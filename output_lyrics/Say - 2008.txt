
Paper doll, come try it on
Step out of that black chiffon
Here's a dress of gold and blue
Sure was fun being good to you

This one we made just for fall
And winter runs a bit too small
This mint green is new for Spring
My love didn't cost a thing

You're like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what theyâ€™re running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll

Fold a scarf, Moroccan red
Tie your hair behind your head
Strap into some heels that hurt
You shoulda kept my undershirt

You're like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they're running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll



Cut the cord and pull some strings
Make yourself some angel wings
And if those angel wings don't fly
Someone's going to paint you another sky

'Cause you're like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they're running from
Was it just too far to fall?
Was it just too far to fall?
