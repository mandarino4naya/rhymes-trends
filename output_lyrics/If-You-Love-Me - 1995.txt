
Ooh yeah, mhm
Yeah, hoo, hoo

I don't wanna rain on this parade
But I'm starting to question the love that was made
I'm not looking for just an affair
Want a love that is based on truth, not just dare

You will not hurt my pride
If right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart
Then it's time that you start
To act like you're mine in the light and the dark

If you love me (Say it)
If you trust me (Do it)
If you want me (Show it)
If you need me (Prove it)
If you love me (Say it)
If you trust me (Do it)
If you want me (Show it)
If you need me (Prove it)


You see now actions speak louder than words
So don't just say things that I've already heard
Don't want your body without your soul
I don't want a lovе who will come here and go

You will not hurt my pridе
If right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart
Then it's time that you start
To act like you're mine in the light and the dark

If you love me (Say it)
If you trust me (Do it)
If you want me (Show it)
If you need me (Prove it)
If you need me (Say it)
If you trust me (Do it)
If you want me (Show it)
(Prove it)

If you love me (Say it)
If you want me, baby (Do it)
I will do what you want me to do (Show it)
Yes, I would (Prove it)
Oh baby (Say it)
Sweet baby (Do it)
Baby... (Show it)
(Prove it)


Oh I, oh I, I wanna touch you, baby
And spread my love, all around you, honey
And if you care, you gotta show it, baby
True love to share

Show it
Prove it
