
I wanna chill (Chill) on Sugar Hill
(It’s so lovely, so lovely)
AZ’s for real
(Oh, he's for real)
He's for real
(It's so lovely, sippin' on bubbly)

At times, I window-watch out the Marriott
Zonin' on ownin' co-ops, foreign drop-top coupes and yachts
Guzzlin' straight shots of scotch
Formulatin' up plots to escape from 'Salem's Lot 'cause it's scorchin' hot
Makin' it hard tryin' to figure who's out to trap me —
Pataki
Got all kinds of undercovers that's comin' at me
Perhaps he won't be happy 'til they snatch me
And place me where half us blacks be,
sittin' in Coxsackie
But never me, see, my destiny's to be forever free
In ecstasy, on a hill that awaits for me
So plush, just to visualize is like a coke rush
Vivid enough to make livin' this a must, plus, it's real...

I wanna chill (Chill) on Sugar Hill
(It’s so lovely, so lovely)
AZ’s for real
(Oh, he's for real)
He's for real
(It's so lovely, sippin' on bubbly)


A-yo, son, pull the shades down and let's count this money
Put the Grants in the safe, 'cause we spendin' the Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how we do

No more cuttin' grams and wrappin' grands up in rubber bands
I'm a recovered man, our plan's to discover other lands
Suburban places got me seekin' for oasis
Cristal by the cases, ladies of all races with dime faces
Sex on the white sand beaches of Saint Thomas
Though this ain't promised, I'm as determined as them old-timers
I want a villa in a Costa Rica
So I can smoke my reefer, and enjoy how life's supposed to treat ya
Laid in the shades of the Everglades, finally forever paid
Wearin' the finest fabrics tailors ever made
Me and my team, Caribbean cuisines
I guess bein' down for so long, I'm all in-store to see my dreams

I wanna chill (Chill) on Sugar Hill
(It’s so lovely, so lovely)
AZ’s for real
(Oh, he's for real)
He's for real
(It's so lovely, sippin' on bubbly)


So until I see past the green pasture
Me bein' supreme master, ain't much more of life I fiend after
But another chapter, a new way of life to adapt to
'Cause these streets'll gas ya, and have ya caught up in the rapture
Déjà vu, I could vision my killer crew more hospitable
Consciously aware, plus political (Political)
'Cause though they claim every man's created equal
Us as native people, find it harder for nights to sleep through
But once established, we eatin' lovely, livin' lavish
Like the House of Versailles in Paris, I gotta have this
It's so plush, just to visualize is like a coke rush
Vivid enough to make livin' this a must, plus, it's real...

I wanna chill (Chill) on Sugar Hill
(It’s so lovely, so lovely)
AZ’s for real
(Oh, he's for real)
He's for real
(It's so lovely, sippin' on bubbly)

It's so crazy, I'm down with AZ
It's so lovely, sippin' on bubbly
It's so crazy, Jones and AZ
It's so lovely, sippin' on bubbly (Woooooo!!)
I wanna chill on Sugar Hill, baby
I wanna chill on Sugar Hill, baby
I wanna chill, I wanna chill
I wanna chill on Sugar Hill, baby
Sugar Hill
