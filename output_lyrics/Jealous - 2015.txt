
I don't like the way he's lookin' at you
I'm startin' to think you want him, too
Am I crazy? Have I lost ya?
Even though I know you love me, can I help it?
(
Jealous, jealous, jealous, jealous
)

I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffin' my chest
I'm gettin' red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why)
I still get jealous
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why)
I still get jealous


I wish you didn't have to post it all
I wish you'd save a little bit just for me
Protective or possessive? Girl
Call it passive or aggressive

I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffin' my chest
I'm gettin' red in the face
You can call me obsessed
Itâ€™s not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why)

'Cause you know I get excited, yeah
When you get jealous, too

I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffin' my chest
I'm turnin' red in the face
You can call me obsessed
