
I know it’s been, I know it’s been way too long now
I didn’t wanna reach out
I needed time for myself
You never said, you never said how you felt, never
Until everything just fell down, yeah
And we’ll never get it back now

Didn’t know how you feeling, and now you want it back
Could've told me this before, when you really had the chance
Why you making me relive it, when it’s all in the past?
Why you making me go through this?
Didn’t know how you feeling, and now you want it back
Could've told me this before, when you really had the chance
Why you making me rеlive it, when it’s all in the past?
Why you making mе go through this?

Boy, you're on my line
This ain’t what it’s ‘sposed to be about
You, you should know this ain’t right
No, I don’t wanna play nice, with ya (With ya)
Boy, you're on my line
This ain’t what it’s ‘sposed to be about
You, you should know this ain’t right
No, I don’t wanna play nice


It never is what it seems, so rollin’ around in these dreams
(Rollin’ around)
You’re not the one that I need, so you left me here on my knees
(You left, you left)
It never is what it seems, so
(It never is what it seems)
Rollin’ around in these dreams
(Rollin’ around)
You’re not the one that I need, so you left me here on my knees
Oh, Oh, Oh
