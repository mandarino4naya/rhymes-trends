Have you ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit, get like me
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the—, get, get like me
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the—, get like me
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit, put it in the air
Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit, put it in the air
Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit, put it in the air
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit

I got a chip in my engine,
twenty-six-inch rims
I got fade-away money,
bitch, I'm ballin' out the gym
Got my old school bumpin', hip wheel on recline
If you think a nigga broke, you out'cha monkey-ass mind (Yeah)
Diamonds on my pinky (Yeah),
hand on the pine
Bitch, you touch and die, your momma do the second line
Screens fallin' from the sky, syrup fallin' in my cup
Old school Chevy thang, comin' down, nigga, what?
Got diamonds in my mouth (Yeah), got some Gucci on my seat
Got G's on my ass,
bitch, it's cold when I speak
Got a freak on my arm, got a charm around my neck
You can gon' pass the mic, watch I'm 'bout to catch wreck
Still screamin' out mayne (Mayne), pistol in my hand
Southside so throwed (Throwed in the game)
Big face on my chain,
eighty-four's on the frame
Big bodies comin' down, hoggin' up both lanes

[Chorus: Yung Joc,
David Banner

Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit, get like me (

Have you ever seen a Chevy with the—, get, get like me

Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit, put it in the air
Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit, put it in the air
Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit, put it in the air
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit

The name you know of
A little bit of change, now your boy done blown up
In them foreign thangs with the guts exposed
Stuntin' ain't a thing to me
And it's obvious, it's plain to see
That you gon' make us both
Get into some thangs that is for grown folks
And they might even say you should leave me alone
Don't be scared
You need to get like me
Stuntin' is a habit, just gotta have it
Shawty keep throwin' that thang at me, I'm gonna bag it
When she see the karats, a real Jessica Rabbit
Can't another boy do the things you like
He ain't your type to change your life
But if you did your homework, girl
I'm pretty sure you know what I got
Drop top, and you know Jones and Banner gonna roll
Let me stop

[Chorus: Yung Joc,
Yung Joc & Chris Brown

Stuntin' is a habit

Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit, put it in the air
Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit, put it in the air
Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit, put it in the air
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors? (Yeah)
Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit

Let them bougie boys ride Maybach ('Bach)
I'm in the candy, laid back like I slang crack (Crack)
My money stacked to the ceilin'
Gettin' in my Chevy's like climbin' up a buildin'
Them twenty-eight's on deck (Deck)
Thirty-seven on my wrist, a hundred-five on my neck (Yeah)
This rap money's okay, but
you should see these movie checks
And this cartoon cash
, the SS so sweet
My Bentley's hatin' on that ass, my old school's gettin' pissed
She opened up her arm, but then she slit both wrists
There go them
suicide doors (Doors)
, wood on the dash
Ferris wheels on the toes (Toes)
and got
duals on the ass
And some chrome on the nose (The nose), the white boys go, "Sweet"
But Black folks go, "Oh," I got a 'llac full of ammo
I'm brick with the nine throwin' bombs out the Lambo' (Uh)
The butterflies goin' up
I got Chad in my heart
and
DJ Screw in my cup


Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit, get like me

Have you ever seen a Chevy with the—, get like me
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit, put it in the air
Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit, put it in the air

Have you ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit
