
Ain't that some back home, buddies in the field, mud on the wheels, yeah
Ain't that some thick smoke, Silverado, tearin' up a two-lane road
Ain't that some C-O-U-N-T-R-Y, shit we been doin' since we was yea high
There's folks out there ain't T-R-Y-D this
Man, ain't that some shit

That you'd hate to grow up and miss
Hate to think of what if
I didn't even know what a honey hole with a Zebco
And my jeans rolled and a pinch of Skoal in my lip even is
They say
we ain't got a pot to piss but I thank God for this

Ain't that some back home, buddies in the field, mud on the wheels, yeah
Ain't that somе thick smoke, Silverado, tearin' up a two-lanе road
Ain't that some C-O-U-N-T-R-Y, shit we been doin' since we was yea high
There's folks out there ain't T-R-Y-D this
Man, ain't that some shit
Ain't that some, ain't that some, ain't that some shit
Yeah

My true North is due South with a blue Coors goin' down
Just like that settin' sun on my old Z-71
I know it's cliché to sing Chevrolets, cold beers and Fridays
But that's just the way it is out here


Ain't that some back home, buddies in the field, mud on the wheels, yeah
Ain't that some thick smoke, Silverado, tearin' up a two-lane road
Ain't that some C-O-U-N-T-R-Y, shit we been doin' since we was yea high
There's folks out there ain't T-R-Y-D this
Man, ain't that some shit
Ain't that some, ain't that some, ain't that some shit


Ain't that some back home, buddies in the field, mud on the wheels, yeah
Ain't that some thick smoke, Silverado, tearin' up a two-lane road
Ain't that some C-O-U-N-T-R-Y, shit we been doin' since we was yea high
There's folks out there ain't T-R-Y-D this
(Ain't) Ain't that some back home
Ain't that some thick smoke, Silverado
Ain't that some C-O-U-N-T-R-Y, we'll be doin' this 'til the day we die
There's folks out there ain't T-R-Y-D this
(Ain't) Ain't that some shit
Ain't that some, ain't that some, ain't that some shit
Ain't that some, ain't that some shit
