
If your kiss turned me to stone
I'd be a statue standing tall in ancient Rome
And if your touch shattered me like glass
I’d be in pieces trying to make the breaking last

If it took one look to turn my days to night
At least I'd have the stars that sparkle in your eyes

There's just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we met you’d be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I'd love you anyway

I know just tryin' to write a song
I run the risk that I could get your perfect wrong
And well, I guess what I'm tryin' to say
Is there ain't words been made could shoulder so much weight

And if you turned your back on me and walked away
Not a thing about the way I feel would change


There's just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I’d love you anyway


There’s just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I’d love you anyway

Even if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I'd love you anyway
