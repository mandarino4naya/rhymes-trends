
Damn, this motherfucker too crazy, Saucii
Let that shit ride, Eighty8
When the shit over, it's over
I don't know what's after or, you know

I keep my gun in my drawers, ducking the sad news (Oh yeah)
My phone say seven missed calls, I know it's bad news
This life had left me so scarred, I'm knowing that's true
Remember times got so hard, I got it tattoed (So hard)
I ain't did no shows but made some bread (Yeah)
I gotta keep the family fed (Yeah, yeah)
Look, just talked to pops about the feds
I ain't gon' lie, he had me scarеd, uh
I feel 'em coming, nigga (Yeah)
I'll keep on running, nigga (Yeah)
If wе go down bad, keep it a hundred, nigga
My girl all in my ear screaming, "Spend some time"
I promise I'll be here when I can get some time
Right now, I got to get what's mine (For sure)
I'll be thuggin' 'til the end of time
And fuck these niggas 'cause they lame
Since they love saying my name
Make sure you write the truest in the motherfucking game


On my tombstone when they bury me
By the river, they will carry me
Finally, I'll be resting in peace
Finally, finally
I'll get to fly away, somewhere, someday
Fuck these niggas 'cause they lame
Since they love saying my name (Yeah)
Make sure you write the truest in the game
On my tombstone when they bury me (Yeah)
By the river, they will carry me (Yeah)
Finally, I'll be resting in peace (Oh yeah)
Finally, finally, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

(You know what I’m saying, I don’t really know what I’m saying, I don’t know what’s after this shit)
Finally, finally (Everybody think they know but fuck it, I sleep on the floor)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (This shit comes with a lot, it’s a lot of pressure, I’m a young nigga though)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
On my tombstone when they bury me (Believe that man, I’m a hustler)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, on my tombstone when they bury me, yeah oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, finally I'll be resting in peace
Finally, finally, on my tombstone when they bury me
By the river, they will carry me, I'll be resting in peace
Finally, finally, yeah
