[Intro: Pitbull,

Went from Mr. 305
(Dade County)
To Mr. Worldwide (All around the world,
ayy, ayy
)
And now we're international, so international (
Oh, yeah
)
International (Woo!), so international

You can't catch me, boy (Can't catch me, boy)
I'm overseas at about a hundred G's per show
Don't test me, boy (Don't test me, boy)
'Cause I rap with the best for sure
305 'til the death of me (Yeah)
Cremate my body, let the ocean have what's left of me (Uh-huh)
But for now, forget about that
Blow the whistle, baby, you the referee, dale
[Chorus: Chris Brown,
Pitbull

You put it down like New York City, I never sleep (

Hotter than Miami, I-I-I feel the heat (Oh, yeah)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Girl, it's), it's international love (
International

I don't play football, but I've touched down everywhere, everywhere? Everywhere (Dale)
I don't play baseball, but I've hit a home run everywhere, everywhere (Dale)
I been to countries and cities I can't pronounce and to places on the globe I ain't know existed (Yeah)
In Romania, she pulled me to the side and told me, "Pit, you can have me and my sister" (Woo!)
In Lebanon, yeah, the women are bomb
And in Greece, you guessed it, the women are sweet
Been all around the world, but I ain't gon' lie
There's nothin' like Miami's heat, dale (Woo!)

Down in DR, they're lookin' for visas
I ain't talkin' credit cards, if you know what I mean (¿Qué lo que?)
En Cuba, la cosa está dura
But the women get down, if you know what I mean
In Colombia, the women got everythin' done
But they some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen
In Brazil, they're freaky with big ol' booties
And they thongs, blue, yellow and green
En L.A., tengo la Mexicana
En New York, tengo la boricua
Besito' para toda' la' mujere' en Venezuela (Muah)
Y en Miami, tengo a cualquiera (Woo!)
