
She asked me where I's from
I said, "Somewhere ya never been to
Little town outside of Knoxville"
Hidden by some dogwood trees
She tried talkin' with my accent
We held hands and waded into
That blue water, she left her flip-flops
By my
Red Wings
on the beach

Yeah, but now I'm dodgin' potholes
In my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado
Headed right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissеd me
Tells me shе'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me
Was some sand in my boots

I said, "Let's go shoot tequila"
So, we walked back to that beach bar
She said, "Don't cowboys drink whiskey?"
(Huh)
So, we drank bottom shelf
She said, "Damn, that sky looks perfect"
I said, "Girl, you've never seen stars
Like the ones back home"
And she said, "Maybe I should, see 'em for myself"


Yeah, but now I'm dodgin' potholes
In my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado
Headed right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me
Tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me
Was some sand in my boots

I said, "Meet me in the mornin'"
And she told me I was crazy
Yeah, but I still thought that maybe she'd show up

Aw, but now I'm dodgin' potholes
In my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado
Headed right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me
Tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me
Was some sand in my boots
Yeah, but all I brought back with me
Was some sand in my boots
