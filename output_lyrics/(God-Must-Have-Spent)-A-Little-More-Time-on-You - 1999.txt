
Yeah...
Yeah hey
Oh yes
Oh oh oh, yeah, yeah

Can this be true?
Tell me, can this be real?
How can I put into words what I feel?
My life was complete
I thought I was whole
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?
[Pre-Chorus 1: Justin
with Chris
]
I never thought that love could feel like this
And then you change my world with just one kiss
How can it be that right here with me
There's an angel? It's a miracle
[Chorus: All,
Justin
]
Your love is like a river
Peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret
that I
never could keep
When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you


Oh...
A little more time
Yes he did, baby

In all of creation
All things great and small
You are the one that surpasses them all
More precious than any diamond or pearl
They broke the mold when you came in this world
[Pre-Chorus 2: JC
with Chris
]
And I'm trying hard to figure out
Just how I ever did without
The warmth of your smile
The heart of a child
That's deep inside, leaves me purified...
[Chorus: All,
JC
,
Justin
]
Your love is like a river
Peaceful and deep
(and deep)
Your soul is like a secret
that I
never could keep
When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you

[Middle 8: JC
with Chris
,
Justin
]
On you, on you, on you, you
(Yes he did, babe)
On you, on you, on you, you
(Oh, oh oh)
On you, on you, on you, you
(Yeah ooh...)
On you, on you, on you, you
(Yeah, hey, hey)
[Reprise: Justin
with JC
]
I never thought that love could feel like this
And you changed my world with just one kiss
How can it be that right here with me
There's an angel? It's a miracle...
[Chorus: All,
Justin
,
JC
]
Your love is like a river
Peaceful and deep
(peaceful and deep)
Your soul is like a secret
that I
never could keep
When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you
(On you, on you, on you, you)
God must have spent a little more time
On you, you... (yeah...)


A little more time on you...
Oh oh, oh oh oh
