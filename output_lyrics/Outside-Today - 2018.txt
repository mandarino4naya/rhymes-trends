
Yeah, I ain't going outside today
Yeah, pour me up
DMac got me too bangin'
(Slatt)

Tryna hide from the camera
I ain't goin' outside today
Couldn't find Hi-Tec
So I'm drinkin' on Act' today
I'ma pull up in style
We gon' do a drive by in the Wraith
I'ma take it to trial
Pray to Lord I beat the case

That money be callin'
I don't do no talkin'
So get the fuck outta my face
Got a TEC and a chopper
With a hundred thousand dollars up in the
Wraith
You know I ain't slippin'
You know that I'm with it
I'll shoot him right up in his face
3Three say that I'm trippin'
You know that I'm drippin'
I'm wrapped in Saran today
I just bought a brand new watch from God
I ain't put it on yet
I don't care 'bout no bitch
I ain't givin' her shit
Spend it all on my homies
I can put on my son, from my car to my house
Everything, I own it
When it come to that money you know I ain't stuntin'
I be on it
I just got a pet monkey, cashed out on a tiger
But really don't want it, my son don't like him
He say that we beefin', you know I won't fight him
My clip full of thunder, you know that I'll strike 'em
Wanna join NBA, go and catch you a body
Free Kevin Gates, it's a murder for hire
Double G gang on the front of my title
Got rid of my Glock and I bought me a rifle


Tryna hide from the camera, I ain't goin' outside today
Couldn't find Hi-Tec, so I'm drinkin' on Act' today
I'ma pull up in style, we gon' do a drive by in the Wraith
I'ma take it to trial, pray to Lord I beat the case

I jump out at your house
I ain't shootin' from the corner
Been bought me a bitch but I really don't want her
I don't do no cappin', I keep it one hunnid
Right now I'm recordin' with ten thousand on me
He say he want smoke but I know he don't want it
Shoot him and his bitch and I up on his homie
You know how I'm feelin'
I don't got to say it
Face every problem all by my lonely

Tryna hide from the camera, I ain't goin' outside today
Couldn't find Hi-Tec, so I'm drinkin' on Act' today
I'ma pull up in style, we gon' do a drive by in the Wraith
I'ma take it to trial, pray to Lord I beat the case
