
Them neon lights
Look good on you, so good on you
But we ain't got
No room to move, no room to move
We need some space and I know a place
Outside of town where it don't ever close down
No, we never close down

Yeah, we can two-step
Put your boots on, baby, we can do that
Girl, cut a little loose, you can move that
Move that, aw, yeah

I'll take you dancin' in the country, Levi's in them low beams
Spin you in some red dirt, sweep you off of both feet
Out here where the sun sets, Silverado backbeat
You'll never wanna go home and never wanna not be
Dancin' in the country
Dancin' in the country

Yeah, it goes left, right, left
You makin' me wanna sway
You makin' me wanna play
Some Alabama and Jackson
Got you 'round my neck
You makin' me wanna stay
You makin' me wanna lay
You down here in the pasture


Yeah, we can two-step
Put your boots on, baby, we can do that
Girl, cut a little loose, you can move that
Move that, aw, yeah

I'll take you dancin' in the country, Levi's in them low beams
Spin you in some red dirt, sweep you off of both feet
Out here where the sun sets, Silverado backbeat
You'll never wanna go home and never wanna not be
Dancin' in the country
Dancin' in the country
Oh, yeah

I know you feel that heat
Watermelon summer
Get them Luccheses
Stompin' like the thunder, yeah

We can two-step
Put your boots on, baby, we can do that
Girl, cut a little loose, you can move that (Woo)
Move that, aw, yeah


I'll take you dancin' in the country, Levi's in them low beams
Spin you in some red dirt, sweep you off of both feet (Oh, yeah)
Out here where the sun sets, Silverado backbeat
You'll never wanna go home and never wanna not be
Dancin' in the country (Don't stop, don't stop, keep it movin')
Dancin' in the country (Don't stop, don't stop, keep it movin')
Dancin' in the country (Don't stop, don't stop, keep it movin')
Oh, yeah
Dancin' in the country (Don't stop, don't stop, keep it movin')
Oh, dancin' in the country (Let's go)
