It's 5 o' clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you'd go in to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there 
Until I heard you come up the stairs 
And I pretended I was sleeping 
And I was hoping you would— 

It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and I want ya
And you want me, don't ya?
I can see it, 'cause you've been waiting on me
Since I said that I was hitting in the club
The Sun be coming up on me
And I know you be getting so horny (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
'Cause you be sending me texts-es
Like, "Boy, just get your ass up in that car
And come get all of this love"
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) You ain't got to remind me
She already said if I don't come on time, she—
Might go crazy
And she'll be waiting on me naked with one of my chains on
She might come and find me (Ah-ah-ah)
And then ask me kindly— (Ah-ah-ah)
Do I want her to go crazy? We do this every night
And then, we always wake up singing the same song

It's 5 o' clock in the morning
Conversation got boring (Talk to me, girl)
You said you'd go in to bed soon (Let's go)
So I snuck off to your bedroom (Come on)
And I thought I'd just wait there (Wait on me)
Until I heard you come up the stairs (I won't let you stay lonely)
And I pretended I was sleeping (All right)
And I was hoping you would creep in (Goodnight)

It's 5 o' clock in the morning
The conversation got boring
You said you'd go in to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom

Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping (Oh, oh-oh)
And I was hoping you would creep in

It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and you calling
And these females got me stalling
I can hear your voice in my head, like
"What is he doing?" (Oh) "What is he doing?"
'Cause I keep checking my cell phone and these missed calls
And you texting me, like, "I'ma kill y'all
If you don't get your ass up out of that club
And do you know what time it is?"
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) Ooh (Ooh)
Well, my bad, girl
And this Nuvo got me tripping, and I know that you mad, girl
But you ain't got to worry about nothing (Worry 'bout nothing)
Girl, I got you (I got you), girl I got you
She might come and find me-ee (Nah-nah-nah)
And then ask me kindly-y (Oh, no, no)
Do I want her to go crazy? (Crazy) We do this every night
And then, we always wake up singing the same song

Oh-oh, and you ain't got nothing on
But the T-shirt that I left over your house the last time I came and put it on ya
Too many thirsty girls up in this club for me to leave here with one of them—that's why I call her
And you'll be right at home, waiting for me
IPhone plugged in the wall, just waiting for me
Club closed at 6, left around 4:30
Yeah, so by the time I'm at your crib—
And you yawning
But I’ve been drinking all night, and I feel like performing
With you in the bedroom, floor to the dresser
Dont want nothing less 'cause I’m sure you’re the best, you’re the one
So I let you—that's how you show me love
And when we finished, you like, “Damn, babe, you woke me up”
I like you way you put it down, like it's for both of us
The sun ain't the only thing that's coming up
