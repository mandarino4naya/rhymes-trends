I'm fifteen for a moment
Caught in between ten and twenty
And I'm just dreamin'
Countin' the ways to where you are
I'm twenty-two for a moment
And she feels better than ever
And we're on fire
Makin' our way back from Mars

Fifteen, there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to lose
Fifteen
There's never a wish better than this
When you only got a hundred years to live

I'm thirty-three for a moment
I'm still the man, but you see, I'm a they
A kid on the way, babe
A family on my mind
I'm forty-five for a moment
The sea is high
And I'm headin' into a crisis
Chasin' the years of my life

Fifteen, there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to lose yourself within a mornin' star
Fifteen, I'm all right with you
Fifteen
There's never a wish better than this
When you've only got a hundred years to live

Half time goes by, suddenly you're wise
Another blink of an eye, sixty-seven is gone
The sun is getting high, we're moving on...

I'm ninety-nine for a moment
And dyin' for just another moment
And I'm just dreamin'
Countin' the ways to where you are

Fifteen, there's still time for you
Twenty-two, I feel her too
Thirty-three, you're on your way
Every day's a new day
Ooh-ooh, who, ooh-who-who
Ooh-ooh, who, ooh-who-who
Ooh-ooh, who, ooh-who-who, who-who-who

Fifteen, there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to choose, hey fifteen
There's never a wish better than this
When you've only got a hundred years to live
