
You say, "What if I hurt you? What if I leave you?
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
What if this goes south? What if I mess you up?"
You say, "What if I break your heart in two, then what?"

Well, I hear you, girl, I feel you, girl, but not so fast
Before you make your mind up, I gotta ask

What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it? What if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close? What if I lean in
And the stars line up and it's our last first kiss?
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?
[Verse 2: Kane Brown &
Lauren Alaina
]
What if the sky falls (
Sky falls
)
Or the sun stops burnin'?
We could worry about them what ifs 'til the world stops turnin'
Or I could kiss you (
You should kiss me
)
What if you liked it? (
Bet I'd like it
)
Well, we ain't never gonna know unless we try it

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina,
Kane Brown
]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it? What if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close? What if I lean in
And the stars line up and it's our last first kiss?
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?
Aw, yeah
Come on

You say, "What if I hurt you? What if I leave you?
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?"
Damn

What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it? What if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
Yeah, what if I just pull you close? What if I lean in
And the stars line up and it's our last first kiss?
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?
[Outro: Kane Brown &
Lauren Alaina
]
Away (
Away
)
What if?
