La-da, la-da-di-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
La-da, la-da-da, la-da-da
La-da, la-da-di-da

I got my head out the sunroof
I'm blastin' our favorite tunes
I only got one thing on my mind
You got me stuck on the thought of you
You're makin' me feel brand new
You're more than a sunshine in my eyes

You got those pretty eyes in your head, you know it
You got me dancin' in my bed, so let me show it
You are exactly what I want, kinda cool and kinda not
Wanna give myself to you

Yeah, we're drivin' down the freeway at night
I only got one thing in the back of my mind
(You got me stuck on the thought of you)
I'm feelin' like this might be my time to shine
With you, with you, with you


I got my head out the sunroof
I'm blastin' our favoritе tunes
I only got one thing on my mind
You got me stuck on thе thought of you
You're makin' me feel brand new
You're more than a sunshine in my eyes

I got my head out the sunroof
Oh woah, oh woah, ooh
You got me stuck on the thought of you
Oh woah, oh woah, ooh
