
We've been burnin' both ends
Keepin' the lights on
So I've been thinkin' we need
A little time alone

So what you say we cancel our plans?
Tonight I'm only gonna be your man

Let's get some candles burning
And some records turning
All the lights down low
Take it nice and slow
The way your body's moving
Keep doing what you're doing to me all night long
Writin' our love song
Girl, I want it, gotta have it
Let the passion take us to a higher place
Makin' the kind of love we make

There ain't no way, baby
To get me out this house
When you look this good
What could I even think about? Oh, oh


Besides turn around and lockin' the door
Watching your red dress fall to the floor

Let's get some candles burning
And some records turning
All the lights down low
Take it nice and slow
The way your body's moving
Keep doing what you're doing to me all night long
Writin' our love song
Girl, I want it, gotta have it
Let the passion take us to a higher place
Makin' the kind of love we make

Kind of love we make

So what you say we cancel our plans?
Tonight I'm only gonna be your man

Let's get some candles burning
Some records turning
All the lights down low
Take it nice and slow
The way your body's moving
Keep doing what you're doing to me all night long
Writin' our love song
Girl, I want it, gotta have it
Let the passion take us to a higher place
Girl, I want it, gotta have it
Let the passion take us to a higher place
Makin' the kind of love we make
Kind of love we make
Makin' the kind of love we make
