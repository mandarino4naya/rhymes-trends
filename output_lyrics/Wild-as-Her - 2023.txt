
She never wanted to be white-picket fenced in
Her heart's like a feather in a Tulsa wind
Seaside breeze'll bring her to life
And all them other boys say she's a goodbye girl
She'll wreck your world
And leave before the mornin' sun
But here she is, free, lyin' next to me
'Cause I ain't tryna tame her love

I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just lookin' for somebody as wild as her
Wild
Wild

Saw that highway unwind in her deep-brown eyes
She saw a long stretch of dirt road dreamin' in mine
She ain't livin' for a diamond ring
Just livin' like the rock 'n' roll song she sings out loud
We're burnin' it down
Blazin' up a trail of smoke
Wherever we are, wherever we go
Yeah, that's where she calls home


I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just lookin' for somebody as wild as her
Wild
Wild
Yeah, yeah, man

Yeah
I ain't tryna fix her, I just wanna kiss her
Fuel a little fire in her soul
No, we don't say "forever," but when we're together
Swear that we ain't ever lettin' go, yeah, she knows

I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just lookin' for somebody as wild as her
Wild
Wild

Yeah
