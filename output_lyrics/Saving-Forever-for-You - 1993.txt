
I've never been so sure about anything before
But this loving feeling
Gonna be a feeling I feel forevermore

Looking in your eyes
Tomorrow's all I see
As long as there's forever, baby
I will always be

Saving forever for you, baby
You are the only one
I'll ever give forever to
Love for a lifetime won't do, baby
Wanna always stay together
So I'm saving forever for you

You'll be my world as long as
There's a world turning around
And you'll be my heaven, baby
'Til the heavens all come falling down
(All come falling down)


Look inside my heart
Love is all you'll see
Loving you forever, baby
Living just to be

Saving forever for you, baby
You are the only one
I'll ever give forever to
Love for a lifetime won't do, baby
Wanna always stay together
So I'm saving forever for you

Forever
I'll be loving you
Long as the time passes by
I'll there beside you
All through it all
I'll be standing by you

Looking in your eyes
Tomorrow's all I see
Long as there's forever, baby
I will always be
Needing you here with me
