[Chorus: Camila Cabello &
mgk
]
Am I out of my head? Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say? It's complicated
Don't matter what you say, don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good (
So good
), that you can't explain it
What can I say? It's complicated (
Ayy
)

Nothing's that bad if it feels good
So you come back like I knew you would
And we're both wild and the night's young
And you're my drug, breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum, I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tat, eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips while my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life and you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

I want you forever, even when we're not together (Ayy, ayy)
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever, like (Ayy, ayy)
I want you forever, even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever, uh (Yeah)

[Chorus: Camila Cabello &
mgk
]
Am I out of my head? Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say? It's complicated
Don't matter what you say, don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say? It's complicated (
Damn
)
[Verse 2: mgk,
Camila Cabello
&
Both
]
I can't explain it, I love the pain (Ayy, ayy)
And I love the way that your breath numbs me like novocaine
And we are always high (
Ooh
)
,
keep it strange
Okay, yeah, I'm insane, but you the same
Let me paint the picture, uh (
Yeah
), couch by the kitchen, ayy (
Yeah
)
Nothin' but your heels on, losin' our religion (
Mm
)
You're my pretty little vixen and I'm that voice inside your head
That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say
And you said
[Pre-Chorus: mgk &
Camila Cabello
]
I want you forever, even when we're not together (Ayy, ayy,
yeah
)
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever, like (Ayy, ayy)
I want you forever, even when we're not together (
Oh
)
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever, uh (Yeah)


Am I out of my head? Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say? It's complicated
Don't matter what you say, don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say? It's complicated
[Bridge: Camila Cabello &
mgk
]
The way we love is so unique (
Ayy, ayy
)
And when we touch, I'm shivering
And no one has to get it, just you and me (
Right
)
'Cause we're just living between the sheets (
You said
)
[Pre-Chorus: Both,
mgk
&
Camila Cabello
]
I want you forever, even when we're not together (
Ayy, ayy, yeah
)
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever, like
I want you forever, even when we're not together (
Ayy, real talk
,
oh
)
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever, yeah (
Oh, baby
)
[Chorus: Camila Cabello &
mgk
]
Am I out of my head? Am I out of my mind? (
Am I? Am I?
)
If you only knew the bad things I like (
If you only knew
)
Don't think that I can explain it (Yeah)
What can I say? It's complicated (
Yeah
)
Don't matter what you say, don't matter what you do (
Do, do
)
I only wanna do bad things to you (Yeah)
So good, that you can't explain it (
So good
; oh, baby)
What can I say? It's complicated
