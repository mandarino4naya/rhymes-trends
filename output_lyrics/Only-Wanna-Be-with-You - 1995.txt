
You and me, we come from different worlds
You like to laugh at me when I look at other girls
Sometimes, you're crazy and you wonder why
I'm such a baby 'cause the Dolphins make me cry

Well, there's nothing I can do
I've been looking for a girl like you

You look at me, you got nothing left to say
I moan and pout at you until I get my way
I won't dance, you won't sing
I just wanna love you, but you wanna wear my ring

Well, there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you

Put on a little Dylan, sittin' on a fence
I say that line is great, you ask me what it meant by
Said I shot a man named Gray, took his wife to Italy
She inherit a million bucks and when she died, it came to me

I can't help it if I'm lucky
I only wanna be with you
Ain't Bobby so cool?
I only wanna be with you


Yeah I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
Only wanna be with you

Sometimes, I wonder if it will ever end
You get so mad at me when I go out with my friends
Sometimes, you're crazy, then you wonder why
I'm such a baby, yeah, the Dolphins make me cry

But there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you


Yeah, I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
