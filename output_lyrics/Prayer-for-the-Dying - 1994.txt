
Fearless people
Careless needle
Harsh words spoken
And lives are broken
Forceful agin'
Help me, I'm fadin'
Heaven's waitin'
It's time to move on

Crossin' that bridge
With lessons I've learned
Playing with fire
And not getting burned
I may not know what you're going through
But time is the space between me and you
Life carries on
It goes on

Just say, "Die," and that would be pessimistic
In your mind, we can walk across water
Please don't cry, it's just a prayer for the dyin'
I just don't know what's got into me


Been crossin' that bridge
With lessons I've learned
Playin' with fire
And not gettin' burned
I may not know what you're goin' through
But time is the space between me and you
There is a light through that window
Hold on say, "Yes," while people say, "No"
Life carries on
It goes on
I'm crossin' that bridge
With lessons I've learned
I'm playin' with fire
And not gettin' burned
I may not know what you're going through
But time is the space between me and you
There is a light through that window
Hold on say, "Yes," while people say, "No"
Life carries on
It goes on
It goes on
Goes, goes
Life carries on

When nothin' else matters
When nothin' else matters
I just don't know what's got into me
It's just a prayer for the dyin'
For the dyin'
