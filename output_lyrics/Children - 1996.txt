
They say everything has its reason
Today I have my doubts
Like 22 children on a bus go into
A tunnel and never come out

They say the higher that you climb
The further that you fall
Like 22 dreams come true
And then they crash into a concrete wall

You can dig a hole
When the mountain’s too high
You can build a bridge
Where the river’s too wide

But what do you do when your head hangs heavy
And the weight is in your chest
Today I can’t seem to figure out
How the worst brings out the best

They say everything has its reason
Today I have my doubts
Like 22 children on a bus go into
A tunnel and never come out


They say time will heal all wounds
Today there's only pain
Like 22 children on a bus came home
In the belly of a military plane

You can dig a hole
When the mountain’s too high
You can build a bridge
Where the river’s too wide

But what do you do when your head hangs heavy
And the weight is in your chest
Today I can’t seem to figure out
How the worst brings out the best

You can dig a hole
When the mountain’s too high
You can build a bridge
Where the river’s too wide

But what do you do when your head hangs heavy
And the weight is in your chest
Today I can’t seem to figure out
How the worst brings out the best


No, today I can't seem to figure out
How the worst brings out the best
