
Dancin' in the kitchen, you singin' my favorite song
Swingin' on the front porch, just laughin' at the dogs
How you swear you love me more when you're whispering, "Goodnight"
All those little moments are every reason why

I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feeling'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it
That all I wanna do
Is be alone with
Your brown eyes all tangled up
Just holdin'
Onto you tonight
Until the mornin'
Baby, that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
I'm homesick for you

Well, it says "Kane Brown" on a sign with a line out the door
It sold out some little town I've never been before
Yeah, they're screamin' my name, this is what we dreamed about
But out here singin' 'bout you, baby, all I'm thinkin' 'bout


I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feeling'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it
That all I wanna do
Is be alone with
Your brown eyes all tangled up
Just holdin'
Onto you tonight
Until the mornin'
Baby, that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
I'm homesick for you

Homesick for you
Yeah, yeah

I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feelin'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it
That all I wanna do
Is be alone with
Your brown eyes, just tangled up
Just holdin'
Onto you tonight
Until the mornin'
Baby, that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
I'm homesick for you


I'm homesick for you
Yeah, yeah
