
I just saw you go, you just slipped away
And now I'm frozen, can't explain
Your silhouette, gone, I fear it fades away
If I can turn back time, turn back time, it'll say
One more goodbye, a twist of fate
You know what I'd do? I'd turn it back again each day

One last kiss, tell me it's alright
One last tear, wipe it from my eye
You always said, "There's no need to be shy
It's okay to cry, it's just one more goodbye"
One last smile, don't you worry now
One last laugh, remember how it sounds?
You always said, "There's no need to be shy
It's okay to cry, it's just one more goodbye"

Another time and place, another time and place, I know
A different kind of way, a different kind of seed we sow, but
But our memory, oh, never really goes
Never goes, never goes
So, why we frozen and emotional? (Emotional)
Don't know what we're waitin' for
'Cause we say it won't be long, no more longer than a song
That goes on and on, and on, and on


One last kiss, tell me it's alright
One last tear, wipe it from my eye
You always said, "There's no need to be shy
It's okay to cry, it's just one more goodbye"
One last smile, don't you worry now
One last laugh, remember how it sounds?
You always said, "There's no need to be shy
It's okay to cry, it's just one more goodbye"

So long is a long, long time, I know, if I can go back for one
(It's okay to cry) more, (It's just one more goodbye)
Farewell's never farewell when feelings are never gone
(It's okay to cry) no, (It's just one more goodbye)
The park bench in Old Town, covered in leaves, yeah
Covered in more kinds than one
(It's okay to cry, it's just one more goodbye)
Least I can still take a seat, close my eyes and remember
(It's okay to cry) you know I love, love

One last kiss, tell me it's alright
One last tear, wipe it from my eye
You always said, "There's no need to be shy
It's okay to cry, it's just one more goodbye"
One last smile, don't you worry now
One last laugh, remember how it sounds?
You always said, "There's no need to be shy
It's okay to cry, it's just one more goodbye"
