Don't look back
Don't ya look back
Oh you're not ready for that
Ain't nothin' in the rearview mirror
Except a whole lotta tears
Eyes on the road, hands on the wheel
Can't think about the way it feels
You've got the kind of heart
That'll change your mind
Girl follow those white lines
Just drive
Drive away
Don't turn around
Cuz if you turn around
You know you're gonna wanna stay
Move on, a little further down the line
Still a few hundred more miles til daylight
It's gonna be alright
Just drive
It's just a town, a Texas town
A map dot on dusty ground
A awful nest of memories
Oh and broken dreams

Just drive
Drive away
Don't turn around
Cuz if you turn around
You know you're gonna wanna stay
Move on, a little further down the line
Still a few hundred more miles til daylight
It's gonna be alright
Just drive
Don't slow down
You're almost to that city limit sign
Just drive
Just drive
Drive away
Don't turn around
Cuz if you turn around
You know you're gonna wanna stay
Move on, a little further down the line
Still a few hundred more miles til daylight
It's gonna be alright
Just drive
Oh, don't look back
Don't ya look back
Girl you're not ready for that
