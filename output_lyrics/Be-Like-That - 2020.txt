
I might be better on my own
I hate you blowin' up my phone
I wish I never met your ass
Sometimes it be like that
But I'm not myself the nights you're gone
There ain't no way I'm movin' on
I'm not afraid to need you bad
Sometimes it be like that

We both wanna love
We both wanna slide
We both wanna argue until we're both right
And you want a hug
I kiss you goodnight
Maybe we're both just out of our mind (Ooh)
And you throw tantrums while I'm twistin' up
No medicine is fixin' us
Can't tell you why but tell you what
You got me thinkin'
[Chorus: Kane Brown &
Swae Lee
]
I might be better on my own
I hate you blowin' up my phone
I wish I never met your ass
Sometimes it be like that
But I'm not myself the nights you're gone
There ain't no way I'm movin' on
I'm not afraid to need you bad (
Bad
)
Sometimes it be like that


I cross the seas wit' you (Hey, seas)
Wasn't even supposed to be wit' you (Yeah, be)
Yeah, and it gets crazy in the night
I cannot sleep with you (Sleep with you)
And I could keep you nice and warm (Ayy)
Won't do no thinking, I'm in love (Yeah, yeah)
If I was to give you the world (Yeah)
That's anything that you can think of (Of)

Got too much goin' to be upset
I swear I'd rather be your friend
I said I'm gonna be right back
It hurts, sometimes it be like that

Swae Lee

Sometimes it be like that


Sometimes, when you thought you found the love of your life (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Now you're thinkin' I'm just one of those guys, leading on
I can't help when you read it wrong
Don't know why I trip on us
You put me down, I pick you up
Can't tell you why but tell you what (You should know that)
You got me thinkin'

Kane Brown & Khalid

Yeah, yeah
Sometimes when you're fallin' off track
Baby, don't you leave me like that
Don't cry
'Cause we're both just out of our mind, yeah, ayy-ayy
