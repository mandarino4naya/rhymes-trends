
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night, she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left, but she's right though
At night, she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

She'll make you curse, but she a blessin'
She'll rip your shirt within a second
You'll be comin' back, back for seconds
With your plate, you just can't help it

No, no
You'll play alo-o-ong, let her lead you o-o-on
You'll be sayin', "No, no"
Then sayin', "Yes, yes, yes," 'cause she messin' with your head

So left, but she's right though
At night, she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Grab-a-cop-gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say, "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night, she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"


See, someone said don't drink her potions
She'll kiss your neck with no emotion
When she's mean, you know you love it
She tastes so sweet, don't sugarcoat it

No, no
You'll play alo-o-ong, let her lead you o-o-on
You'll be sayin', "No (No, no, no), no (No)"
Then sayin', "Yes, yes, yes," 'cause she messin' with your head

You're just like me, you're out your mind
I know it's strange, we're both the crazy kind
You're tellin' me that I'm insane
Boy, don't pretend that you don't love the pain
