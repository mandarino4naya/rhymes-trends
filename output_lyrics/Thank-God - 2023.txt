
I was lost, you found a way to bring me back
Needed forgiveness, you always gave me that
Girl, I'm a witness of your love 'cause you don't be givin' up
And it's crazy how you saved me

Hand on the Bible
Don't know how I got you
But I couldn't ask for more
Girl, what we got's worth thanking God for
[Chorus: Kane Brown,
Both
,
Katelyn Brown
]
So thank God
I get to wake up by your side
And thank God
your hand fits perfectly in mine
And thank God
you loved me when you didn't have to
But you did, and you do,
and He knew
Thank God for giving me you
(
Hey, yeah
)
Thank God, thank God (
Hey, yeah
)
For giving me you

Never thought I'd find an angel undercover
Made a change to evеrything from my heart to my last name, hey
Hard to tеll, when he fell, that boy was Heaven sent
And every night when I close my eyes, before I say "Amen"

[Chorus: Both,
Kane Brown
]
I thank God I get to wake up by your side
And thank God your hand fits perfectly in mine
And thank God you loved me when you didn't have to
But you did, and you do, and He knew
Thank God for giving me you
Thank God, thank God,
yeah, yeah
Thank God,
ooh-ooh
[Pre-Chorus: Katelyn Brown,
Kane Brown
]
Hand on the Bible
Don't know how I got you

Girl, what we got's worth thanking God for

So
thank God I get to wake up by your side
And thank God your hand fits perfectly in mine
And thank God you loved me when you didn't have to
But you did, and you do, and He knew
Thank God for giving me you
Thank God

Thank God
