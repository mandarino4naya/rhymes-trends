
I know you're home
You left your light on
You know I'm here
The night is thin
I know you're alone
I watched the car leave
Your lover is gone
Let me in

Open your back door
I just need to touch you once more
Oh, oh

I wanna come over
To hell with the consequence
You told me you love me
That's all I believe
I wanna come over
It's a need I can't explain
To see you again
I wanna come over

I know your friend
You told her about me
She filled you with fear
Some kind of sin
How can you turn
Denying the fire?
Lover I burn
Let me in


Open your back door
I just need to touch you once more
Oh, oh

I wanna come over
To hell with the consequence
You told me you love me
That's all I believe
I wanna come over
It's a need I can't explain
To see you again
I wanna come over

Oh
Oh

I know you're confused
I know that you're shaken
You think we'll be lost
Once we begin
I know you're weak
I know that you want me
Lover don't speak
Let me in


I wanna come over
To hell with the consequence
You told me you love me
That's all I believe
I wanna come over
It's a need I can't explain
I wanna come over
To see you
To see you again
