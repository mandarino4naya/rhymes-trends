
"Man, I can't fuckin' believe this!
How can the same shit happen to the same guy twice?"
"Girls, girls, girls, girls"

A-yo, sweetie! You're lookin' kinda pretty
What's a girl like you doin' in this rough city?
I'm just here tryin' to hold my own ground
Yeah! I think I like how that sound
What you say we gets to know each other better?
That sounds good, but I don't think that I can let ya
I don't know, tell me is it so..
Do you get a kick out of tellin' brothers no?
No, it's not that, see, you don't understand
How should I put it? I got a man!
What's your man got to do with me?
I told ya!
I'm not tryin' to hear that, see?
I'm not one of those girls that go rippin' around
I'm not a duck, baby, so don't play me like a clown
I'll admit, I like how you kick it
Now you're talkin' baby, that's the ticket!
Now, don't get excited and chuck your own hand
I already told ya — I got a man!


What's your man got to do with me?
I got a man!
I'm not tryin' to hear that, see?
I got a man!
What's your man got to do with me?
I got a man
I'm not tryin to hear that!

Now, you can persist to play Don Juan all night
But ain't nothin' gonna change
Yeah, baby, sure, you're right!
I'mma break it down, and do whatever I gots to do
I tell you now — I got eyes for you!
You got eyes, but they not for me
You better use them for what they for, and that's to see
You know what's the problem? You’re young and still learnin'
I'm Big Daddy Longstroke, and your man's Pee Wee Herman
I got a question to ask you, troop
Are you a chef? 'Cause you keep feedin' me soup
You know what they say about those who sweat theyself
You might find yourself, by yourself
I'm not waitin' because I'm no waiter
So when I blow up, don't try to kick it to me later
All them girls must got you gassed
Well, when they see a good thing, they don't let it pass
Well, that's OK, 'cause see, if that's their plan
'Cause for me, I already got a man!

I got a man!
I'm not tryin' to hear that, see?
I got a man!
What's your man got to do with me?
I got a man!
I'm not tryin to hear that!

What am I? Some crab inmate
That just came home from jail, sweatin' you for a date?
I don't want no beef, I just wants to get together!
By how you talkin'? Pssssh! Whatever!
We can't have nothin'?
It all depends
Well, if we can't be lovers, then we can't be friends
Well, then I guess it's nothin'
Well, hey! I think you're bluffin'!
Well, I'mma call my man
Well, I can get raggamuffin!
You better catch a flashback — remember, I'm not crabbin' it
You know my style from "I'm Not Havin' It"
All I remember's an "Excuse me, miss"
You can't get a girl like me with a line like this
Well, look, I'll treat you good
My man treats me better
I'll talk sweet on the phone
My man writes love letters
I'll tell ya that I want ya, and tell ya that I care
My man says the same, except he's sincere
Well, I'm clean, cut and dapper — that's what I'm about
My man buys me things and he takes me out
Well, you can keep your man 'cause I don't go that route!
Bwoy, yah know yah haffa respeck mi?
There's a lot of girls out there who won't say no
Yah out for mami wit' yah DJ Money
Uh! Boom! Batter my pockets is gettin' fatter
I wanna turn you on and excite ya
Let me know the spot on your body and I'll bite ya
So when your man don't treat you like he used to
I kick in like a turbo booster!
You want lovin'? You don't have to ask when
Your man's a headache, I'll be your aspirin
All confusion, you know I'll solve 'em
I got a man!
You got a whut?! How long you had that problem?
