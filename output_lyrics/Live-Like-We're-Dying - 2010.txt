
Oh, yeah, yeah

Sometimes we fall down, can't get back up
We're hiding behind skin that's too tough
How come we don't say "I love you" enough?
'Til it's to late
It's not too late

Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come
And we could make a feast from these crumbs, yeah
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun
So if your life flashed before you
What would you wish you would've done?

Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got, then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got eighty six, four-hundred seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying, oh


And if your plane fell out of the skies
Who would you call with your last goodbye?
Should be so careful who we let fall out our lives
'Cause when we long for absolution
There'll be no one on the line, yeah

Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got, then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying, oh
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying
We only got eighty six, four-hundred seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying
Yeah
Mm


You never know a good thing 'til it's gone
You never see a crash 'til it's head on
Why do we think we're right when we're dead wrong?
You never know a good thing 'til it's gone

Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got, then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying, oh
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying
We only got eighty six, four-hundred seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying
