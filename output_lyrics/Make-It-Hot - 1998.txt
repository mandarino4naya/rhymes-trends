
But uh, anyway, you could catch me any day
Sippin' Hennessy and my peeps get plenty yay
Or many ways to see that I hold this dough
Cats fake it, I made it, I told you so
Mocha Latte, kid, me no play
Stress-free, sexy in Montego Bay
You know it's a pity that y'all look like idiots
Yo boo, let me know when I should rip this cat

My man, he don't call me anymore
We don't even kiss
Am I his fool?
What must I do to keep him loving me?
All this love I give
That ain't cool
[Chorus: Keli Nicole Price |
Nicole Wray
]
I got what you want (
Got what you want
)
Got what you need (
I got what you need
)
Can I get another shot? (
Ooh-ooh
)
This time I'ma make it hot (
Come on
)
I got what you want (
Got what you need
)
Got what you need (
Baby
)
Can I get another shot? (
Come on
)
This time I'ma make it hot (
Come on
)


Call my man at the crib
He turned off his phone
Said to call him back
Why? Silly me
Why didn't I suspect he was making love
To someone else?
Boy, you killing me
[Chorus: Keli Nicole Price |
Nicole Wray
]
I got what you want (
Got what you want
)
Got what you need (
I got what you need
)
Can I get another shot? (
Come on, baby
)
This time I'ma make it hot (
Oh-oh
)
I got what you want (
Got what you want
)
Got what you need (
I got what you need
)
Can I get another shot? (
Oh

This time I'ma make it hot
[Bridge: Keli Nicole Price |
Nicole Wray
]
Oh yeah, yeah (
Oh yeah, yeah

Oh yeah, yeah (
Oh yeah, yeah

Oh yeah, yeah (
Oh, oh oh oh oh

Oh yeah, yeah
[Chorus: Keli Nicole Price & Missy Elliott |
Missy Elliott

I got what you want
I got what you need
Can I get another shot?
This time I'ma make it hot (
Now, now, now
)
I got what you want
I got what you need
Can I get another shot?
This time I'ma make it (
Yo
)


I'm sittin' on the side of the curb with a pocket of herb
I don't know if y'all heard I'm high as a bird
I can fly like Kelly
, I glide like skates
Me with no Timbaland is like Puff with no Ma$e
Wait, hold up, wait a minute, what you say?
Back it up, give me space, who that? Nicole Wray
By the way, DJ, better play all day
Make the whole world say, "Damn, they sick of me!"

Yo, yo, yo, haha
Yeah, this that kinda joint
That make everybody wanna bop they head
Haters, lovers, whatever, haha
Nicole Wray, Timbaland, Mag-a-noo, Aaliyah
Ginuwine, Missy, ha, Playa
[Chorus: Keli Nicole Price |
Timbaland
]
I got what you want (
I got what you want
)
Got what you need (
What?
)
Can I get another shot? (
Yes, you can
)
This time I'ma make it hot (
Oh, really?
)
I got what you want (
Do you?
)
Got what you need (
I bet you do
)
Can I get another shot? (
Oh, yes, you can
)
This time I'ma make it hot (
Really?
