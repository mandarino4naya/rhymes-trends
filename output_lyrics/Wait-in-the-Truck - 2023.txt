
I got turned around in some little town
I'd never been to before
Workin' my way through a middle of June
Midnight thunderstorm
There was somethin' in the headlights
That stopped me on a dime
Well, she was scared to death
So I said, "Climb in," and in she climbed
Oh, yeah

Well, she was bruised and broke from head to toe
With a tear in her blood-stained shirt
She didn't tell the whole truth, but she didn't have to
I knew what had happenеd to her
I didn't load her down with questions
That girl had been through еnough
I just threw it in drive, looked in those eyes
And asked her where he was
[Chorus: Lainey Wilson,
HARDY & Lainey Wilson
]
I don't know if he's an angel
'Cause angels don't do what he did
He was hellbent to find the man behind
All the whiskey scars I hid
I never thought my day of justice
Would come from a judge under his seat
But I knew right then I'd never get hit again when he said to me
"Wait in the truck
Just wait in the truck"


Well, I knocked and knocked and no one came
So I kicked in his double-wide door
I let the hammer drop before he got
To that 12 he was reachin' for
I didn't try to hide my pistol
I didn't even try to run
I just sat on the porch, smokin' one of his cigarettes
And waited for the cops to come
[Chorus: Lainey Wilson,
HARDY & Lainey Wilson
]
I don't know if he's an angel
'Cause angels don't do what he did
He was hellbent to find the man behind
All the whiskey scars I hid
I never thought my day of justice
Would come from a judge under his seat
But I knew right then I'd never get hit again when he said to me
"Wait in the truck
Just wait in the truck"
[Post-Chorus: HARDY,
Lainey Wilson
,
Both
]
Whoa (
Oh
)
Have mercy on me, Lord
Have
mercy on me
Have mercy on me, Lord (
Oh
)


It's been sixty months and she still comes
To see me from time to time
It was worth the price to see a brighter side
Of the girl I picked up that night
And I might be here forever
It ain't paradise, that's true
But it's a whole hell of a lot better
Than the place I sent him to
Yeah
[Outro: HARDY & Lainey Wilson,
Choir

Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me

Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me

"Wait in the truck, just wait in the truck"
(
Lord, have mercy

Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me
)
(
Have mercy on me, Lord, have mercy on me
)
(
Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me
)
(
Have mercy on me, Lord, have mercy on me
)
(
Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me
)
"Wait in the truck, just wait in the truck"
(
I need You to have mercy, oh, have mercy
)
(
Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me
)
"Wait in the truck, just wait in the truck"
(
Please have mercy, please have mercy
