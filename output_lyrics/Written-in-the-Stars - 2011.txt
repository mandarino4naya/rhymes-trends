
Oh, written in the stars
A million miles away
A
message to the main
, oh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way
(Let's go!)

Yeah, you're listenin' now
They say they ain't heard nothin' like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials
'Cause I got more fuckin' hits than a disciplined child
So when they see me everybody brrrap, brrraps
Man Iâ€™m like a young gun fully black Barack
I cried teardrops over the Massive Attack
I only make hits like I work with a racquet and bat
Look at my jacket and hat, so damn berserk
So down to earth, I'm bringin' gravity back
Adopted by the major
, I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed
Look, I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malorie Blackman
(Where the hell's all the sanity at?) Damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
That's why you have to keep screamin' 'til they hear you out


Oh, written in the stars
A million miles away
, a
message to the main,
oh
Seasons come and go, but I will never change
And I'm on my way

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Oh)

Yeah, I needed a change, when we ate, we never tipped
Because we needed the change, I needed a break
For a sec, I even gave up believing and praying
I even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray
They say that money is the root to the evilest ways
But have you ever been so hungry, it keeps you awake?
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed, great
It feels like a long time coming, fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream, I tried to chase it
But I wasn't going nowhere,
running man
I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Tryna change a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyone's a kid that no one cares about
You just gotta keep screaming 'til they hear you out


Oh, written in the stars
A million miles away
