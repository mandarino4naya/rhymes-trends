
The trouble with a heartbreak (Heartbreak)

Don't let anybody tell ya it's gonna be easy ('Cause it ain't easy)
Don't let anyone tell ya they know what it's like
Mmh, when they say
"Get out on this town, meet somebody new, get lost in the crowd" all I see is you
Don't let anybody tell ya it's gonna be easy

And that's the trouble with a heartbreak, it's gonna hang around
Leave you midnight breakin' down, wonderin' how
Long that it's gonna take gettin' over her
It's a can't drown whiskey down kinda hurt
Yeah, you can burn thеm four wheels up that road
But there ain't nowherе her memory can go
That's the trouble with a heartbreak
Yeah, that's the trouble with a heartbreak, a heartbreak, yeah
(Heartbreak, heartbreak, heartbreak)

Think about where she is, who she's drivin' crazy (Drivin' me crazy)
Can't see a rearview sunset without thinkin' 'bout us
Girl, I still think about us


And that's the trouble with a heartbreak, it's gonna hang around
Leave you midnight breakin' down, wonderin' how
Long that it's gonna take gettin' over her
It's a can't drown whiskey down kinda hurt
Yeah, you can burn them four wheels up that road
But there ain't nowhere her memory can go
That's the trouble with a heartbreak
Yeah, that's the trouble with a heartbreak, a heartbreak, yeah
Oh, yeah
That's the trouble with a heartbreak

Get out on this town, meet somebody new
(Meet somebody, get out of this town)
Get lost in the crowd, all I see is you

And that's the trouble with a heartbreak, it's gonna hang around
Leave you midnight breakin' down, wonderin' how
Long that it's gonna take gettin' over her
It's a can't drown whiskey down kinda hurt
Yeah, you can burn them four wheels up that road
But there ain't nowhere her memory can go
That's the trouble with a heartbreak
Yeah, that's the trouble with a heartbreak, a heartbreak, yeah


Heartbreak, heartbreak, oh yeah
That's the trouble with a heartbreak, oh yeah
