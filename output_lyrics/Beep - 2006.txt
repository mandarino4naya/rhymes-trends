It's funny how a man only thinks about the ****
You got a real big heart, but I'm lookin' at yo' ****
You got real big brains, but I'm lookin' at yo' ****
Girl, it ain't no pain in me lookin' at yo' ****
I don't give a ****, keep lookin' at my ****
'Cause it don't mean a thang if you're lookin' at my ****, hah
I'ma do my thing while you're playin' wit ya ****
Ha, ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha

Every boy's the same
Since up in the seventh grade
They've been tryna get with me
Tryna "Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha"
They always got a plan
To be my one and only man
Wanna hold me with their hands
Wanna "Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha"


I keep turning them down
But they always come around
Asking me to go around
That's not the way it's going down
'Cause they only want, only want
My ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Only want, what they want
But, na-ah-ah, na-ah-ah

Do you know that no
Don't mean yes, it means no?
So just hold up, wait a minute
Let me put my two cents in it
One; just be patient
Don't be rushin' like you're anxious
And two; you're just too aggressive
Tryna get your (Ah)

Do you know
That I know?
And I don't
Wanna go there
Yeah, they only want, only want
My ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Only want, what they want
But, na-ah-ah, na-ah-ah
