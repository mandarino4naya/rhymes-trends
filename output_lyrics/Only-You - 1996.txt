
Oh, I need to know where we stand
Do we share this special thing called love?
I know I do, what about you?
I just can't get enough of your time

I need you in my life
Where do I go?
What do I do?
I can't live without your love
Thinkin' of you, makes me feel
Like I'm the only one for you
[Chorus: 112,
Slim
]
Girl, I want to (
Yes, I do
) be with you (
Oh
)
No one else, only you (
Oh
)
Why can't we just (
Why can't we just
) make it happen? (
Oh
)
Baby,
I need you in my life

Every time I'm with you
Never want it to come to an end
Always make me so happy
You'll always have a place in my heart

[Pre-Chorus: Slim,
Puff Daddy
]
I need you in my life
Where do I go?
What do I do?
'Cause I can't live without your love
Thinkin' of you, makes me feel
Like I'm the only one for you

Je-sus, the Notorious just
Please us with your lyrical thesis
We just chillin', milk 'em, top billin'
Silk and pure linen, me and Little Cease (
Ha
)
Malibu sea breeze, Dom P's, palm trees
Cats named Pablo in milked out Diablos
(
That's right
)
The Williest (What?), bitches be the silliest
The more I smoke, the smaller the phillie gets
Room 112 where the players dwell
And stash more cash than Bert Padell, inhale
Make you feel good like Tony! Toni! Ton√©! (
Feels good
)
Dig up in your middle like Monie
(
Yes
) (
Yeah
)
She don't know but she settin' up to blow me (
Yes
)
Try to style, slides off with a homie (
Yes
)
Escada, Don Dada, player, stay splurgin'
Game so tight they call it virgin (
Whoa-oh, yeah
) (
Yes
)


Where do I go?
What must I do?
If I can't live without your love?
Thinkin' of you, makes me feel, baby
Like I'm the only one for you
[Chorus: 112,
Slim
]
Girl, I want (
Girl, I want
) to be with you (
Oh yeah
)
No one else (
I need you in my life

Oh baby
)
Why can't we just (
Why can't, why can't we
) make it happen? (
Oh

Baby,
I need you in my life
(
Oh baby, I love you
)
Girl, I want to (
I need you
) be with you
(
Want you here with me
)
No one else (
Oh, oh
), only you (
It's only you
)
Why can't we just (
Why can't we
) make it happen? (
Oh
)
Baby,
I need you in my life
(
Girl, I love you
)
Girl, I want to (
And I need you

(
Gotta have you in my life

No one else (
Oh yes, I do

Why can't we just make it happen? (
Oh

Baby,
I need you in my life

Oh, oh

Girl, I want to be with you
No one else, only you
