
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion, endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your high love and emotion, endlessly

'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Yeah you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home

I got my eyes on you

You're the girl
You're the one
Gave you everything I love
I think there's something
(I think there's something)
I think there's something
(I think there's something)
You're the girl

Gave you everything I love
I think there's something
