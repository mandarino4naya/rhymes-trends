
Ah, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Almost made you love me, almost made you cry
Almost made you happy, babe, didn't I, didn't I?
You almost had me thinkin' you were turned around
But everybody knows, almost doesn't count
Almost heard you sayin' you were finally free
What was always missing for you, babe, you found it in me
But you can't get to heaven half off the ground
Everybody knows, almost doesn't count

I can't keep on loving you one foot outside the door
I hear a funny hesitation of a heart that's never really sure
Can't keep on tryin' if you're looking for more
Than all that I could give you, than what you came here for

Gonna find me somebody not afraid to let go
Want a "No doubt, be there" kind of man
You came real close
But every time you built me up, you only let me down
But everybody knows (Everybody knows)
Almost doesn't count (Almost doesn't count)


Hey (Oh, oh)
Hey (Ooh, whoa, everybody knows)
Ah, hey (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hey
Hey (I can't keep on, baby)
Hey (Can't keep on tryin')
Everybody knows (Everybody knows)
Almost doesn't count (I can't keep on)

I can't keep on lovin' you one foot outside the door (Woo-woo, I hear a)
I hear a funny hesitation of a heart that's never really sure (Ooh, never really sure)
Can't keep on tryin' if you're looking for more (No, no)
Than all that I could give you, than what you came here for (Ooh, babe)

Maybe you'll be sorry, and maybe you'll be cold
Maybe you'll come runnin' back, babe
From the cruel, cruel world
Almost convinced me you're gonna stick around
But everybody knows (Everybody knows)
Almost doesn't count

So, maybe I'll be here, maybe I'll see you around
That's the way it goes, almost doesn't count
