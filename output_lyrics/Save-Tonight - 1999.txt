
Go on and close
The curtains
'Cause all we need
Is candlelight
You and me
And a bottle of wine
Gonna hold you tonight
Uh, yeah

Well, we know
I'm going away
And how I wish
I wish it weren't so
So, take this wine
And drink with me
Let's delay our misery

Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone


There's a log
On the fire
And it burns
Like me for you
Tomorrow comes
With one desire
To take me away
Oh, it's true

It ain't easy
To say goodbye
Darling, please
Don't start to cry
'Cause, girl, you know I've got to go
Oh
And, Lord, I wish it wasn't so

Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone


Tomorrow comes
To take me away
I wish that I, that I could stay
Girl, you know I've got to go
Oh
Lord, I wish it wasn't so

Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone

Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
Tomorrow I'll be gone


Tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow I'll be gone

Save tonight
Save tonight
Save tonight
Save tonight
Oh, that's right?
Save tonight
Save tonight
Save tonight
Save tonight
Yeah, that's right?
