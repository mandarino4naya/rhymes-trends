
You said you hated the ocean, but you're surfin' now
I said I'd love you for life, but I just sold our house
We were kids at the start, I guess we're grown-ups now, mmm
Couldn't ever imagine even havin' doubts
But not everything works out, no

Now I'm out dancin' with strangers
You could be casually datin'
Damn, it's all changin' so fast

Así e' la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around and it knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
Así e' la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life, baby
I was barely standin', but now I'm dancin'
He's all over me (Goza)

Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam (Así e' la vida)
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam


It's been a hell of a year, thank God we made it out
Yeah, we were ridin' a wave and trying not to drown
And on the surface, I held it together
But underneath, I sorta came unwound
Where would I be? You're all that I need
My world, baby, you hold me down
You always hold me down
[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran,
Ed Sheeran & Camila Cabello
]
Well, I've been the
breaker and broken
Every mis
take turned to moments
Wouldn't take anything back
[Chorus: Both,
Camila Cabello
&
Ed Sheeran
]
Así e' la vida, sí (
Así e'
)
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around and it knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
Así e' la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life, baby
I was barely standin', but now I'm dancin'
She's all over me
(
He's all over me
)

Camila Cabello
