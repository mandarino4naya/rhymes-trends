Yo, on some real shit, I need somebody I could chill with (

I had a girl that would've
died for me
Didn't 'preciate her so I made her
cry for me
Every night she had tears in her
eyes for me
Caught a case, shorty took the whole
ride for me
At first we were friends then became lovers (
Oh
)
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers (
Oh
)
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really wanna
But every time I think about your pretty smile (
Oh
)
And how we used to drive the whole city wild (
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
)
Damn, I wish you would've had my child (Come on)
A pretty little girl with Diddy's style
Shit is wild
All them days that I reminisce (Uh huh)
About the way I use to kiss them pretty lips (Come on)
But as long as you happy, I'ma tell you this
I love you, girl, and you're the one that I will always miss
I love you, yeah (
