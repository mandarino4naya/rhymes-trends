I told my mama,
I told my friends
When it comes to her
, when it comes to him,
never again
Last time was the last time, that time nearly did us in
Yeah, too much drama
Girl, you're a match
, you're gasoline,
we just burn too fast
So here we are
, lightin' up that spark
Yeah, we tried to run
,
but we didn't get far

I never say never with you, I end up together with you
It's hell and it's heaven with you, baby
Anything's possible, the highs are unstoppable
It's so uncontrollable, it's crazy
We say we won't and then we do
You're all I want, I never say never with you
[Verse 2: Cole Swindell,
Lainey Wilson
,
Cole Swindell & Lainey Wilson
]
You got a touch that kills me,
makes me feel alive
Couldn't turn me off,
yeah, even if you tried
So keep turnin' me on and turn out the lights
Who knows? Tonight,
we might get it right
[Chorus: Cole Swindell & Lainey Wilson,
Lainey Wilson
]
I never say never with you, I end up together with you
It's hell and it's heaven with you, baby
Anything's possible, the highs are unstoppable
It's so uncontrollable, it's crazy
We say we won't and then we do
You're all I want, I never say never with you, yeah
I never say never with you

[Chorus: Cole Swindell,
Lainey Wilson
,
Cole Swindell & Lainey Wilson
]
I never say never with you,
I end up together with you
It's hell and it's heaven with you,
baby
Anything's possible, the highs are unstoppable
It's so uncontrollable, it's crazy
We say we won't and then we do
You're all I want, I never say never with you
We say we won't,
but what's the use?
Baby, come on,
I'll never say never with you
Oh, no
You're all I want,
I'll never say never with you
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
[Outro: Lainey Wilson,
Cole Swindell
,

I told my mama,
I told my friends
When it comes to her
, when it comes to him,
never again
