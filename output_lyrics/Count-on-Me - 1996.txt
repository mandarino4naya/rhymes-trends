
Oh-oh-oh

If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea
I'll sail the world to find you
If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see
I'll be the light to guide you

We find out what we're made of
When we are called to help our friends in need

You can count on me like 1, 2, 3, I'll be there
And I know when I need it
I can count on you like 4, 3, 2 and you'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are s'posed to do, oh yeah

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, yeah, yeah

If you're tossin' and you're turnin' and you just can't fall asleep
I'll sing a song beside you
And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me
Everyday, I will remind you, oh


We find out what we're made of

You can count on me like 1, 2, 3, I'll be there

'Cause that's what friends are s'posed to do, ah yeah

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, yeah, yeah

You'll always have my shoulder when you cry
I'll never let go, never say goodbye

You know you can count on me like 1, 2, 3, I'll be there
And I know when I need it
I can count on you like 4, 3, 2, and you'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are s'posed to do, oh yeah

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
