
Yeah!
(
Do-ba-dah, do-ba-dee, do-ba-dabadee
)
For the first time, it's going down, history baby
New Three 6 Mafia, featuring 8Ball & MJG, Young Buck
It's a Tennessee thing
We gotta stay...

I gotta stay high-igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh
'Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
I gotta stay high-igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh
'Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
I gotta stay high-igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh
'Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
I gotta stay high-igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh (Yeah)
'Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
(Juicy)

They call me the Juice, so you know I'ma stunt
Riding in the car with some bump in the trunk
Tone in my lap and you know it's a pump
Breaking down the good green, rolling the blunt
Ghetto pimp type, girls say I'm the man
Ice on the wrist with the ice in the chain
Riding through the hood, got me gripping the grain
And I'm sipping the same while I'm changing the lane
Eyes real tight, 'cause I'm choking the green
Vision messed up, 'cause I'm drinking the lean
Messing with a D-boy, riding them big toys
Make your main gal wanna get on my team
She gotta give it up 'fore she get in my car
I ain't Denzel but I know I'm a star
'Cause when I'm in the club, I be back in the fog (Yeah)
In the V.I.P. part and be buying the bar (Yeah)


DJ Paul is a dog, one you do not trust
You leave your green around me, nigga your green gon' get lit up
You leave your drank around me, believe your drank gon' get drunk up
You leave your girl around me, if she bad, she gonna get stuck
These niggas is spies
We live them lives and keep them eyes tight
Riding 'round what they like
Make a couple nuns a couple of dykes
So purple, purple, purple, and swallow it down
With the yurple, yurple, yurple, it's going down

I gotta stay high-igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh
'Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
I gotta stay high-igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh
'Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie

Puff, puff, pass, nigga roll that blunt
Let's get high, nigga, smoke us one (Yeah)
Paul pulled out the Phantom, niggas can't stand it
But them hoes gon' come, I (Oh!)
Just really wanna smoke my weed
Fuck these hoes and stack my G's ([?])
Stop at the light and pause on Three
Hit the mall and it be all on me, but (Let's go)
Gotta keep one eye up on the po-po
Close the window when I roll the indo (Get high)
Know they mad 'cause I'm rolling Benzo
This that purple, not pretendo (Nah)
Three 6 Mafia, them my kinfolks
So when I'm in Memphis, Ten-a-key
I just might not bring my own
'Cause them niggas there let me smoke for free


What's up Mary? How you doing? Mary Jane stalking me
Since I have met you, girl, you're on my brain (On my brain)
You stole my heart (Stole my heart), right from the start (Right from the start)
So I broke you down, look momma put you in the 'gar (Put you in the 'gar)

I gotta stay high-igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh
'Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
I gotta stay high-igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh
'Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
(Yeah)

Premro full of that dro
Leave the club full of Ros√© Mo
Your girlfriend wanna ride with me
In a car with a pimp, where she supposed to be
You ain't met no dude spit it cold as me
The bag of kush, it cost 650
Have a nigga who smoke Reggie Miller
Coughing and choking constantly
Taste like fruit when you hit it
Gotta have bread to get it
Smoke all night, sleep all day
That's should be the American way
Roll that shit, light that shit, hit that shit, hold that shit
Blow that shit out slow, then pass it to me, bro


MJ finna sprinkle in some of that
Super incredible, have a nigga runnin' back
Where the nigga with the good sticky number at?
Cut up a cigarillo like a lumberjack
In the morning, when I need this
And breathe again a whole lot of weed
But I'm needing somebody to give me what I need
When I want nothing less than the best of the trees
DJ Paul and Juicy J, 8Ball & MJG
And Young Buck, we don't give a fuck, we must represent this Tennessee
We drink a whole lot of Hennessy, nigga got a lil' hair on his chest
Do me like Bill Clinton girl, take it out your mouth, we'll shoot it right there on your dress

I gotta stay high-igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh
