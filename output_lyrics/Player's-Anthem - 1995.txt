Bitches (Uh), ha (Uh), uh (
Blast that shit, son
)

Niggas, grab your dick if you love hip-hop
Bitches, rub your titties if you love Big Poppa
Got you open off the words I say because
This type of shit, it happens every day
(
Check it out, uh
)

Now who smoke more blunts than a little bit?
What are you a idiot? Listen to the lyrics I spit like M1's
Got mad guns up in the cabin
'Cause Cease ain't the one for the dibbin' and dabbin' shit
I make it happen, you got your ass caught
All you saw was fire from the Honda Passport
Or the M.P., what if you see, then I miss ya
I blow up spots like little sisters
Gwaan grit ya teeth, gwaan bite ya nails to the cuticles
Like Murray, my killings be the most beautiful
Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique thick like Luke dancers
Niggas grab your gats, bitches take a glance at
The little one, pullin' over in the Land Rover
Playin' Big Willie style with the chauffeur, you know what I mean?
Stack the green, read all between the lines
A nigga act up, makes the bastard hard to find


Niggas, grab your dicks if you love hip-hop
Bitches, rub your titties if you love Big Poppa
Got you open off the words I say because
This type of shit, it happens every day
Niggas, grab your dicks if you love hip-hop
Bitches, rub your titties if you love Big Poppa
Got you open off the words I say because
This type of shit, it happens every day

How you livin' Biggie Smalls?
I'm surrounded by criminals
Heavy rollers, even the sheisty individuals
Smokin' skunk and mad Phillies
Beatin' down Billy Badasses, cracks and stacks in masses
If robbery's a class, bet I pass it
Shit get drastic, I'm buryin' you bastards
Big Poppa never softenin'
Take you to the church, rob the preacher for the offerin'
Leave the fucker coughin' up blood and his pockets like rabbit ears
Covet the wife, Kleenex for the kid's tears
Versace wear, Moschino on my bitches
She whippin' my ride, countin' my ones, thinkin' I'm richest
Just the way players play, all day, every day
I don't know what else to say
I've been robbin' niggas since Run and them was singin' "Here We Go"
Snatchin' ropes at the Roxy, homeboy
You didn't know?
my flow, detrimental to your health
Usually roll for self, I have son ridin' shotgun
My mind's my nine, my pen's my MAC-10
My target, all you wack niggas who started rappin'
Junior M.A.F.I.A. steelo, niggas know the half
Caviar for breakfast, champagne bubble baths
Runnin' up in pretty bitches constantly
The Smalls, bitch, who the fuck it was supposed to be?


Niggas, grab your dicks if you love hip-hop
Bitches, rub your titties if you love Big Poppa
Got you open off the words I say because
This type of shit, it happens every day
Niggas, grab your dicks if you love hip-hop
Bitches, rub your titties if you love Big Poppa
Got you open off the words I say because
This type of shit, it happens every day

I used to pack MACs in Cadillacs
Now I pimp gats in the Ac's, watch my niggas backs
Nines in the stores, Glocks in the bags
Maxin' mini-markets, gettin' money with the Arabs
No question, confession, yes it's the lyrical
Bitches, squeeze your tits, niggas, grab your genitals
Proteins and minerals, exclude subliminals
Big Momma shoots the game to all you Willies and criminals
I kick the really with my peeps all day
325's roll by with the windows down halfway
D-K-N-Y, oh my, I'm jiggy
It's all about the Smalls and my fuckin' nigga Biggie
Bitches love the way I bust a rhyme
'Cause they all in line screamin', "One more time!"
Niggas, grab your dicks if you love hip-hop
Bitches rub-a-dub in the back of the club, straight up
