
Cutting me up like a knife and I feel it
Deep in my bones
Kicking a habit I love even harder
You oughta know

I just wanna dive in the water with you
Baby, we can't see the bottom
It's so easy to fall for each other
I'm just hoping we catch one another (
Another, another
)
[Chorus: Trevor Dahl
with Demi Lovato
]
Oh, na-na, just be careful
Na-na, love ain't simple
Na-na, promise me no promises
Oh, na-na, just be careful
Na-na, love ain't simple
Na-na, promise me no promises

[Verse 2:
Demi Lovato
]
Baby, I think about you and I feel it
Deep in my heart (
Deep in my heart
)
Maybe we just ain't meant to be somethin'
Maybe we are, ooh


I just wanna dive in the water with you
Baby, we can't see the bottom
It's so easy to fall for each other
I'm just hoping we catch one another (
Another, another
)
[Chorus: Trevor Dahl & Demi Lovato,
Demi Lovato
]
Oh, na-na, just be careful
Na-na, love ain't simple
Na-na, promise me no promises
Oh, na-na, just be careful
Na-na, love ain't simple
Na-na, promise me no promises (
Oh
)

[Bridge: Trevor Dahl
with Demi Lovato
]
I just wanna dive in the water
Ooh, baby, we can't see the bottom
I just want to dive in with
you
I just want to lie here with you
, oh
[
Chorus: Trevor Dahl & Demi Lovato,
Demi Lovato
]
Oh, na-na, just be careful
Na-na, love ain't simple (
No
)
Na-na, promise me no promises (
Promise me
)
Oh, na-na, just be careful
Na-na, love ain't simple
Na-na, promise me no promises (
No
)

[Drop: Demi Lovato,
Demi Lovato & Trevor Dahl
]
Oh
Promise me no promises
[Outro: Trevor Dahl,
Demi Lovato
&
Both
]
Don't you promise me nothing
Promise me
Just be careful
Promise me no promises
