
I'm rememberin' I promised to forget you now
But it's rainin' and I'm callin' drunk
And my medicine is drownin' your perspective out
So I ain't takin' any fault
Am I honest still? Am I half the man I used to be?
I doubt it, forget about it, whatever
And the dial tone is all I have

I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown
In the name of someone I no longer know
For the shame of bein' young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio
I don't like that when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emеrgency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang
Evеn the cops thought you were wrong for hangin' up
I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you

I'll die
[Verse 2: Post Malone,
Noah Kahan & Post Malone
]
Drinks pourin', couldn't stop it
Turn another slow dance into a mosh pit
Tuck my head, then I heard the lock and
Told him that my first car was a Crown Vic
Talkin' 'bout last time I was in the back of a cop car
I fell in love
And my face on the cold window
Try to sober back up and loosen my cuffs
And it's all the same anyway

[Chorus: Noah Kahan & Post Malone,
Post Malone
]
Mm
, I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown
In the name of someone I no longer know
For the shame of bein' young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio
I don't like that when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emergency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang
Even the cops thought you were wrong for hangin' up
I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you

Well, I'd die for you
[Bridge: Noah Kahan,
Noah Kahan & Post Malone
]
I beg you, sir, just let me call
I'll give you my blood alcohol
I'll rot with all the burnouts in the cell
I'll change my faith, I'll praise the flag
Let's wait, I swear she'll call me back
"Son, are you a danger to yourself?"
Fuck that, sir, just let me call
I'll give you my blood alcohol
I'll rot with all the burnouts in the cell
I'll change my faith, I'll kiss the badge
Let's wait, I swear she'll call me back
"Son, why do you do this to yourself?"

[Chorus: Noah Kahan & Post Malone,
Post Malone

And I said I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown,
ah
In the name of someone I no longer know (I no longer know)
For the shame of bein' young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio,
ah
I don't like that when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emergency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang
Even the cops thought you were wrong for hangin' up
I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you
