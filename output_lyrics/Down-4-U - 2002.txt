[Chorus: Ashanti &
Ja Rule
]
I wanna be your chick
I wanna be down for you
Do you trust me?
(Yeah)
Love me?
(Yeah)
You puttin' it on me?
You must be
,
your down-ass chick
I wanna be your chick
And only for the Rule, baby
I'll ride for you (
Yeah
), die for you (
Yeah
)
Do anything you want me to, I'll be your down-ass chick (
Yo
)

This is no intention of bein' offensive to women
By calling y'all bitches, my down-ass bitches
Still my queen, princess cuts look clean
On that finger next to the finger you flipped at me
And there's no in between me and you, only me and you
Who else gon' put it on ya like the Rule
?
And God only looks after children and fools
And you're neither, so who gon' look after you? Just Rule, baby

True baby, it's only for you baby
Vita thighs only divide if you inside, 'cause I
Love the way you touch me, nobody can get it
And if it's comin' or gunnin' just consider it's spittin'
So when you gone for a minute, I just fantasize
Like if it's you that's all in it, then I'm satisfied
'Til you come back to me, holdin' stacks and jewels
V-I-T-A and my nigga J-A Rule, baby

[Chorus: Ashanti &
Ja Rule

I wanna be your chick
And only for the Rule, baby
I'll ride for you (
Yeah

Yeah

Do anything you want me to, I'll be your down-ass chick

I'm gonna be here when you need me
Ooh, baby, can always count on me
And you don't ever have to worry (Worry)
You know I'll make it in a hurry (Hurry)
Here for you and I will never leave
Shed tears for you, 'cause boy you got to me
There'll never be another for me (For me)
You'll always be my one and only (Only)

[Verse 5: Charli Baltimore &
Ja Rule
]
Now baby, I told you I can show you better than I can tell
You blow trial, who bring commissaries and mail
You them sweet words and naked flicks?
I'm still that pretty, down, down-ass, two cars behind your six
And I detest any clown that's clockin' my round ass
Only a down-ass and it's all for you
I grown a tad bit since we've been at it like rabbits
The booty a lil' plumper and it's (
All for Rule
)
Shit, who gon' love you like that? Thug with you
With it stacked to the ceiling or splittin' a dub with you
'Cause I play my position with co-Ds, OGs
Until that bloodshed, blood red, or we OD
Remember every word that you told me
Show me, hold me
All you need in your life is Chuck, drugs, and dubs
Or twenty-twos, now tell me, who the honey for you? Chuck
