

And, oh
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And, oh
I can fly, I can fly, I can fly (Fly)
And, oh
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And I'm lovin' every second, minute, hour
Bigger, better, stronger, power
[Chorus: will.i.am,
will.i.am & Justin Bieber
]
I got that power
I got that power
I got that
power
Power, power, power

They call me Will-A
Stay so cool, I'm chilly
I done made that milli'
On my way to that billi'
Used to have a piggy bank
But now I got that bigger bank
Who-who cares what the haters think?
They hatin' on me cause I'm doin' what they can't
I stay on that hustle
I flex that mental muscle
Hate to bust your bubble
I'm on that other level


I'ma take it higher
And high, high and higher
I stay in fly attire
Keep burnin' like that fire
[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am & Justin Bieber,
Justin Bieber
]
And, oh
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And, oh (
Oh
)
I can fly, I can fly, I can fly (
Fly
)
And, oh
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And I'm lovin' every second, minute, hour
Bigger, better, stronger, power
[Chorus: will.i.am,
will.i.am & Justin Bieber
]
I got that power
I got that power
I got that
power
Power, power, power

Y-y-y-yes, y'all
Feelin' funky fresh, y'all
Work to be the best, y'all
Work good under pressure
Been through all that stress, y'all
Get-get this off my chest, y'all
Made it out them projects with this project
That's progress, y'all
I did it for my momma
I told her when I was younger
That I'ma be that number one
Yup, I'll be that number one


I take it higher
And high, high and higher
I stay and buy attire
Keep burnin' like that fire (Fire, fire)

Whatever doesn't kill you
Only makes you stronger
So I'ma get stronger
Comin' like a batterram, batterram
I'm knockin'-knockin' down the door again, door again
Comin'-comin' like a batterram, batterram
I'm knockin'-knockin' down the door again, door again
[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am & Justin Bieber,
Justin Bieber
]
And, oh
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And, oh (
Oh
)
I can fly, I can fly, I can fly (
Fly
)
And, oh
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And I'm lovin' every second, minute, hour
Bigger, better, stronger, power
[Chorus: will.i.am,
will.i.am & Justin Bieber
]
I got that power
