
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Ayy, baby

Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
Sheâ€™s poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, "Oh, good lord," she had them long tanned legs
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said

Well, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you
And this brand new Chevy with a lift kit would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it, heh
So, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

Well, she was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were fallin' in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
"Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck"

Baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you
And this brand new Chevy with a lift kit would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it, heh
So, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise


When that summer sun fell to his knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
Because it felt so right, her and I, man, we felt so right

I put it in park and grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl, you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Hell, I can't get you out of my head

Baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise (Hahaha)
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you

Well, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you
And this brand new Chevy with a lift kit would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it, come on
Baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

Come on, girl
Get those windows down and cruise
Aw, yeah
