
Bury me in Georgia
Mm-hmm
Mm-hmm

Ten miles out of Chattanooga
South of that state line
There's a no-name road off Highway 2
Just past the welcome sign
It's where I was born, it's where I was raised
Ain't sayin' I'm ready yet
But that's the place I wanna be after my last breath

Bury me in Georgia
Let me rest in peace
Underneath the pines, yeah, yeah, yeah
Where my roots run deep (Where my roots run deep)
Whеn it's my day, put me in that clay
And remembеr what I told you
When I die, bury me in Georgia
Mm-hmm

Yeah, I don't care what color my suit is
Or what shoes y'all put on my feet
I don't care how many show up, yeah
Or who reads my eulogy
Just take me out to that graveyard
Sing a send me home song
Put "Go Dawgs" on my headstone
(Headstone)
And pile that red dirt on


Bury me in Georgia (Woo)
Let me rest in peace
Underneath the pines, yeah, yeah, yeah
Where my roots run deep (Where my roots run deep)
When it's my day, put me in that clay
And remember what I told you
When I die, bury me in Georgia
Georgia
Hell, yeah


Check this out
For my final will and testament
Let this be my last request
Leave it all to my family
You already know what's next
Yeah, bury me in Georgia

Bury me in Georgia
Let me rest in peace
Underneath the pines, yeah, yeah, yeah
Where my roots run deep (Where my roots run deep)
When it's my day, put me in that clay
And remember what I told you
When I die, bury me in Georgia
Mm-hmm


Yeah
That's funky right there (Mm-hmm, come on)


Bury me in Georgia
Georgia
