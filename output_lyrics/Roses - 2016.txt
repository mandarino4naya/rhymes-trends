
Take it slow, but it's not typical
He already knows that my love is fire
His heart was a stone, but then his hands roam
I turned him to gold and took him higher

Well, I'll be your daydream, I'll be your favorite things
We could be beautiful
Get drunk on the good life, I'll take you to paradise
Say you'll never let me go
[Chorus: ROZES & Andrew Taggart,
ROZES
]
Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew, hideaway
We could waste the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the back room, hideaway
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go

Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Say you'll never let me go


Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go

Ahh, Ahh
Ahh, Ahh
Say you'll never let me go
[Chorus: ROZES & Andrew Taggart,
ROZES
]
Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew, hideaway
We could waste the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the back room, hideaway
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go

Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Say you'll never let me go

Ahh
Say you'll never let me go
Ahh
