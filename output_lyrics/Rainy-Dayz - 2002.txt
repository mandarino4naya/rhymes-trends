It's just those rainy days
Spend a lifetime tryna wash away
Until the sun come out and shines again
Smile for me, smile for me
All of those rainy days
Spend your lifetime tryna wash away
Until the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me, smile at me

Weâ€™re always livin' so crazy and sexy and cool
And we begin to love it (Begin to love it)
Watchin' all of the heartache and pain of the world
And thinkin' nothin' of it (Thinkin' nothin' of it)
And baby, I got love for you
And I know that you got me, baby (Got me, baby)
But every time the sun shines bright
It gets so cloudy, yeah

[Chorus: Mary,
Ja Rule
]
It's just those rainy days
Spend a lifetime tryna wash away (Tryna wash 'em away)
Until the sun come out and shines again (Until the sun shines)
Smile for me, smile for me (Smile, smile, smile)
All of those rainy days
(All of those rainy days)
Spend your lifetime tryna wash away
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Until the sun shines and I see your face
(Oh yeah, yeah)
Smile at me, smile at me
[Refrain: Mary,
Ja Rule

Nobody loves the rain
Can't stand it
It always seems to fall
Baby, handle it
Baby, didn't we tell you before
About chasin' those waterfalls? Yeah
Nobody loves the rain
Can't stand it
It always seems to fall
Baby, handle it
Baby, didn't we tell you before
About chasin' those waterfalls? Yeah

Yeah, baby, sometimes the Rule don't mind the rain
It kinda feels like I'm drownin' in the Lord's pain
Until the sun comes out and shines again
Smile, give me reason to keep believin'
That everything ain't misleadin'
And I kiss the clouds on them rainy days
And smile for you when your skies are gray, bae
'Cause I'm a teardrop away from cryin'
And a few shots away from dyin'
Dear Lord, would you shower my pain?
Let it rain, let it rain on me
While I cherish the air I breathe
I'm an angel that can't soar, can't fly
And I mastered it, Lord knows why

[Chorus: Mary,
Ja Rule
]
It's just those rainy days
Spend a lifetime tryna wash away
Until the sun come out and shines again (Ooh, just spend a lifetime)
Smile for me, smile for me (Tryna wash them away, away, away, away, away, away)
All of those rainy days
(Away)
Spend your lifetime tryna wash away
(Spend your lifetime)
Until the sun shines and I see your face
('Til the sun shines)
Smile at me, smile at me
(Ooh, smile)

I feel like an angel with my broken wings
So I can soar again, Lord, let me in
Baby, through all the passion, the pain and the hurt
I feel like I'm fallin', yeah
Makin' clothes for all of those that spread love
And for those who can't take it, stand up
Baby, we gon' make it
In the words of Marvin Gaye
War is not the answer

Nobody loves the rain
Can't stand it
It always seems to fall
Baby, handle it
Baby, didn't we tell you before
About chasin' those waterfalls? (Don't go chasin' waterfalls)
Nobody loves the rain
Can't stand it
It always seems to fall
Baby, handle it
Baby, didn't we tell you before
About chasin' those waterfalls? Yeah

[Chorus: Mary,
Ja Rule

It's just those rainy days
Spend a lifetime tryna wash away
Until the sun come out and shines again (Oh, might just spend a lifetime)
Smile for me, smile for me (Tryna wash them away, away, away, away, away, away)
All of those rainy days
(Oh, no, oh, no)
Spend your lifetime tryna wash away
(Oh, no, no)
Until the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me, smile at me

Smile, smile, smile, smile, smile, smile, smile, smile, smile
'Til the
sun shines
Just smile for me
Just smile for me, just smile at me
Know in your heart that we are free
Free to believe
whatever we feel
So feel somethin' real, baby
Hey-ayy
