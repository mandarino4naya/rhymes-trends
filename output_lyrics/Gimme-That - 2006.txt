Chris Brown is in the building

The young boy just turned sixteen and I got (Uh)
Six four's and hot bikes that I rock (Uh)
Keep three or four sweeties on my clock (Uh)
But all that swinging in that bikini just make 'em vicious
Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop (Uh)
'Cause you speak in that slang that I talk (Uh)
That sassy tempo with that walk (Uh)
May be the reason that all these teenies may never see me

Momma you may be three years older but you hot (Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme"
Momma you may be three years older but you hot (Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme"


Ma, take a break, let me explain to you (Woo)
What your body got a young boy ready to do (Woo)
If you take a chance to let me put them thangs on you
I could show you why I make them straight A's at school
I'm a hustler, trust my frame and age
Got you thinking that I'm just too young to turn your page
I can picture us switching lanes
In the coupe, with you on the phone screaming my name (Chris!)

Momma you may be three years older but you hot (Gimme that, hot)
You be talking like you like what I got (Yeah, gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme" (Oh)
Momma you may be three years older but you hot (Hot, gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (Hey, gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac (Ooh)
You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme" (Ooh, oh)
