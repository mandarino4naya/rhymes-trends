
Riding dirty with a deuce
.22 a double sequel
Can of worms just came unloose
Give em hook a line then sinker
We uncouth inside this coupe
Get Madonna from ya diva
Work of art she Mona Lisa

Hundred times for I consider giving shawty back
Universe speaking in colored lines
But I see henderscheme is scattered on my map
World is a product of my design
I done hemmed the hemisphere to fit me exact
How you still broke in 2019?
Do what I can I can’t relate to that
Oh would you look at the time it is
Got a flight to Bermuda at 5:06
That triangle gon' gift me with timelessness
Peep the world getting cold on a climate shift
And if push come to shove shit ain’t going well
Might start serving some sacks to my clientele
Got me doing the dirt in a circle 6
How you look down on me from a higher hell
I’m thinking I lost it, environment toxic burdens now holding me hostage
Pistol is pressed at my conscience
Death might just cock it
Smash on the trigger and pop it
Now I’m dead to the world this a decay
Had to move the whole fam' out the EA
No sports or a damn PS3 game
Type game that’s gon' make a niggas cleats shake
Had to keep my speech to a minimal
Nigga like probably threw 'em off
Throw praise on my name like a synagogue
Feeling like that nigga I’m a city God
I’m afraid for them boys
Might have to listen to my inner voice
Reach for that black steel I’m avoiding a black kill left me wit' no damn choice
Caught me
