[Intro: Lil' Mo &
Angie Martinez
]
Yeah, hey (
Oh, yeah, yeah, Animal House
)
Yeah, hey (
Come on, woo! Come on
)
Ooh
If I can go with you (
Uh, uh, yo, yo, uh
)

If I could choose a place to go, it gotta be far away
From here, we could crossover like Hardaway
Somewhere outside the states, where tomorrow's like today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay
And if I can go with you
T
hen I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin' like leavin' the coast too
Feelin' like leavin' with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin' the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade
When you know what he likes and what he might say
And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways?
And if I can go with you
Way out the states, no two-ways and no page'
No cells and no trace and you just a phone call away, so all I got to say is
[Chorus: Lil' Mo &
Sacario
]
If I can go contigo
I'll pack my things soon as you say
"Baby, vamos," we'll fly away
Like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go contigo
I'll tell my friends nothing at all (
I hear you
)
I'll get my things (
Yeah
), soon as you say (
Talk to me
)
"Baby, vamos" (
C'mon
), we'll fly away

[Verse 2: Sacario &
Lil' Mo
]
And if I could go with you
Oh boy, we 'bout to make a lot of people annoyed
In Croix, you better know I know how to sneak with them toys
Employed with the block since around '94, boy
And if I could flow with you
The thought though, after the studio, I'll roll with you
I'll send Dutch and three other goons to go get you
Sacario, the name awaits the whole issue
Grown men keep on cryin', get mo' tissue (Haha)
The way me and this girl be rhymin', it's so official (Yeah)
That I'm takin' a trip, too, with no pistols (Come on)
'Cause everything peace, only sand, no streets
Little Miami heat, that's the plan we'll see
Two cups, one in Senado one in Sand Beach
Ang, I'll think I'll go with you
So tell the station you need a week,
back to you (
Tell me, oh
)

If I can go contigo
I'll pack my things soon as you say
"Baby, vamos," we'll fly away
Like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go contigo
I'll tell my friends nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say
"Baby, vamos," we'll fly away

[Bridge: Lil' Mo &
Angie Martinez
]
You can fly away, no one has to know
Babe, take me with you, 'cause if I can go
Soon as you say the word, we'll be on our way
To a foreign place, you got to tell me (
Yo, uh
)
[Verse 3: Angie Martinez,
Sacario
,
Angie Martinez & Sacario
,
Lil' Mo
]
So now that we got a plan are you comin'? We could plan a week (
Come on
)
The only question now is LaGuardia or Kennedy?
And a seat, no aisle, the window, 'cause I like to see
(Okay)
And seein' as to how I'm so fly, me and the clouds can speak
And since we 'bout to go in a few
,
go 'head
Oh, I just wanted to tell Trace thank you
That week off, I'm grateful, what was you tryin' to say, boo?
Nothin', just grab my chain off the table and two-way too
Okay, that little place is a great move (
Uh
)
And ain't no problems unless the water don't stay blue
And the shops there?
If they don't got em, they don't make em (
True
)
No concrete, just sand, throw away your shoes
Now that we are on our way
And our bags is packed and the car service is not late (
Come on
)
Everything's okay
, so I guess I'll catch you on the next track
Now I don't gotta ask (
Tell me, oh
)

If I can go contigo
I'll pack my things soon as you say
"Baby, vamos," we'll fly away
Like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go contigo
I'll tell my friends nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say
"Baby, vamos," we'll fly away


If I can go contigo
I'll pack my things soon as you say
"Baby, vamos," we'll fly away
Like there is no, no tomorrow
And if can go contigo
I'll tell my friends nothing at all
Nothing at all, I'll tell my friends
Nothing at all, haha
