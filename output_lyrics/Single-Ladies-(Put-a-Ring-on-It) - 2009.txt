Now put your hands up

Up in the club (Club), we just broke up (Up)
I'm doin' my own lil' thing
You decided to dip (Dip) and now you wanna trip (Trip)
'Cause another brother noticed me
I'm up on him (Him), he up on me (Me)
Don't pay him any attention
'Cause I cried my tears (Tears), gave ya three good years (Years)
You can't be mad at me

'Cause if you like it, then you should've put a ring on it
If you like it, then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
'Cause if you like it, then you should've put a ring on it
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
'Cause if you like it, then you should've put a ring on it

I got gloss on my lips (Lips), a man on my hips (Hips)
On me tighter than my Deréon jeans
Actin' up (Up), drink in my cup (Cup)
I can care less what you think
I need no permission, did I mention?
Don't pay him any attention
'Cause you had your turn (Turn) and now you gon' learn
What it really feels like to miss
Bey

Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
'Cause if you like it, then you should've put a ring on it
If you like it, then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it, then you should've put a ring on it
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Don't treat me to these things of the world
I'm not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Here's a man that makes me then takes me (Ah)
And delivers me to a destiny
To infinity (Infinity) and beyond (And beyond)
Pull me (Pull me in) into your arms (To your arms)
Say I'm the one you want (Ah, I'm the one you want)
If you don't, you'll be alone
And like a ghost, I'll be gone
