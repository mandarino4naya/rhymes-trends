
Firewood crackle in the fall air
"Red Dirt" playing on a radio
Big Dipper hanging high up there
Breathe in the Backwoods and let it go

I ain't ever been the church goin' type
Can't quote much past 3:16
Even though it's a Friday night
Church found me

Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, amen
Killin' time, livin' life with some downhome friends
When the world's gone crazy, man, it all makes sense
Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, amen, amen
[Post-Chorus: Chase Rice &
Tyler Hubbard
]
Tell em' boys
Yeah, baby
[Verse 2: Tyler Hubbard,
with Brian Kelley
]
Gotta thank him for a little piece of dirt
Little peace of mind from a cold one
Got a country angel I don't deserve
The kind that you never let go of

[Pre-Chorus: Florida Georgia Line &
Tyler Hubbard
]
I don't know what Heaven looks like
No, I don't think anybody does
If it's like down here up there tonight
And there's folks like us
[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line &
Brian Kelley
]
Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, Amen (
Talkin' God, amen
)
Killin' time, livin' life with some downhome friends (
With some downhome friends
)
When the world's gone crazy, man, it all makes sense
Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, amen, amen (
Talkin' God, amen
)
(
Talkin' God, amen
)

I don't know what Heaven looks like
And who the hell does?
If it's like down here up there tonight
There's folks like us
[Chorus: All,
Tyler Hubbard
&
Brian Kelley
&
Chase Rice
]
Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, Amen
Killin' time, livin' life with some downhome friends
Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, Amen (
Talkin' God, amen
)
Killin' time, livin' life with some downhome friends (
With some downhome friends
)
When the world's gone crazy, man, it all makes sense (
Man, it all makes sense
)
Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, amen, amen (
Talkin' God, amen
)

[Outro: Florida Georgia Line &
Chase Rice
]
(Sittin' here, drinkin' beer) Talkin' God, amen
(Talkin' God, amen)
We're sittin' here, drinkin' beer
Talkin' God, amen
