
Feels like I'm standing in a timeless dream
Of light mists, of pale amber rose
Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
Touching, discovering you
Those days of warm rains come rushing back to me
Miles of windless summer night air (Summer night, summer night air)
A secret (Secret) moment shared in the heat of the afternoon
Out of the stillness, soft-spoken words

Say it, say it again

I love you always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere, I will be with you
Everything (Say it, say it again), I will do for you
I love you, always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere, I will be with you
Everything, I will do for you

You've got the most unbelievable blue eyes
I've ever seen
You've got me almost melting away
As we lay there
Under a blue sky with pure white stars
Exotic sweetness, a magical time


Say it, say it again

I love you always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere, I will be with you
Everything (Say it, say it again), I will do for you
I love you always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere, I will be with you
Everything, I will do for you

Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never, whatever near and far
And always and everywhere and every
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never, whatever near and far
And always and everywhere and every
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never, whatever near and far
And always and everywhere and every
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never, whatever near and far
And always and everywhere and everything


Yeah, mm, yeah
I love you always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere, I will be with you
Everything, I will do for you
I love you always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere, I will be with you
Everything, I will do for you
I love you always, forever
Near and far, closer together
