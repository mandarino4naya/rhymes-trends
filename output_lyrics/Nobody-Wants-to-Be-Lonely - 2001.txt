[Intro: Ricky Martin &
Christina Aguilera
]
Why? Why? Why?
Oh-oh, ooh, ah, ah-ah, ah
[Verse 1: Ricky Martin,
Christina Aguilera
,
Both
]
There you are, in a darkened room
And you're all alone, looking out the window
Your heart is cold and lost the will to love
Like a broken arrow
Here I stand in the shadows (
In the shadows
)
Come to come, come to me
Can't you see that

Nobody wants to be lonely?
Nobody wants to cry
My body's longing to hold you
So bad, it hurts inside
Time is precious and it's slipping away
And I've been waiting for you all of my life
Nobody wants to be lonely
So why (Why), why don't you let me love you?
Why, why, oh, why?
[Verse 2: Christina Aguilera &
Ricky Martin
,
Both
]
Can you hear my voice? Do you hear my song?
It's a serenade, so your heart can find me, oh
And suddenly, you're flying down the stairs
Into my arms, baby, oh
Before I start going crazy
(Goin' crazy)
Run to me
(Run to me)
'cause I'm dying

[Chorus: Ricky Martin with Christina Aguilera &
Ricky Martin
]
Nobody wants to be lonely (
Wants to be lonely
)
Nobody wants to cry
My body's longing to hold you (
I'm longing to hold you
)
So bad it hurts inside
Time is precious and it's slipping away
And I've been waiting for you all of my life
Nobody wants to be lonely
So why (Why), why don't you let me love you?
[Bridge: Ricky Martin,
Christina Aguilera
,
Both
]
I wanna feel you need me (
Feel you need me
)
Just like the air you're breathing (
Breathing
)
I need you here in my life
Don't walk away
,
don't walk away
Don't walk away, walk away
No, no, no, no
Nobody wants to be lonely
Nobody wants to cry
,
yeah, yeah
[Chorus: Ricky Martin,
Christina Aguilera
,
Both
]
Nobody wants to be lonely (
Yeah, oh
)
Nobody wants to cry (
Nobody wants to cry
)
My body's longing to hold you
(
Is longing to hold you
)
So bad, it hurts inside
Time is precious and it's slipping away
And I've been waiting for you all of my life
Nobody wants to be lonely
So why
(Why),
why don't you let me love you?
Nobody wants to be lonely
Nobody wants to cry
(
Nobody wants to cry
)
My body's longing to hold you (
I'm longing to hold you
)
So bad, it hurts inside
